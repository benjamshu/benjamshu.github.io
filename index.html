            <p>Hi :) My name is <u>benjam</u>, although i might go by something else next week, who knows, because i'm really insecure. I make stuff and post it online because i care about people and it helps me cope with life.</p>
            <p>I figure most people probably want to visit this site for one of three reasons: to find out <a href="#who">who i am</a>, to find out <a href="#what">what i've done</a>, or to find out <a href="#how">how to get ahold of me</a>. So i've gone ahead and put all three of those things right here on the front page! They have nice headings, too, so you can save yourself from reading the sections you don't want. If you're <em>really</em> a rebel, you could try reading them all ;)</p>
            <section id="who">
                <h2>who is</h2>
                <p>I'm a college student (ew) from the pacific northwest. I'm supposed to be getting a degree in math. I don't really like math that much anymore but the degree is basically done, so… y'know. I love <a href="https://youtu.be/iGQRTVTV7eA" target="_blank">music</a> and like <a href="http://miraongchua.tumblr.com/tagged/miss%20bird%20and%20miss%20cat" target="_blank">comics</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113824/" target="_blank">animation</a> and hate videogames but still play them sometimes. I'm a pretty good writer but rarely have time to read. I'm interested in linguistics and criticism when it's not being a butt. Criticism can sometimes be a butt.</p>
                <p>I'm trans (in the everyone-but-me-seems-to-think-i'm-a-man direction), which is a word i'm not entirely 100% sure about applying to myself, but do anyway because trans ppl (myself included) have bigger things to worry about than whether they are "really trans" or just "kinda trans". I can't take selfies or use pictures of myself as avatars on social media because i don't like feeling dysphoric every time i make a post. I figure that's trans enough.</p>
                <p>I care about ppl, but i'm shitty at taking on systemic problems because i have difficulty putting myself out there like that, so instead i tend to focus on individuals and small communities. I don't like feeling alone and i figure other ppl probably don't either. I do media criticism when i find something meaningful out of the hope that maybe others will see the same sort of meaning i do. I try not to do negative criticism because i figure someone probably likes the thing i don't and i don't want them to feel bad for liking it.</p>
                <p>I'm ace, which means i won't know what you're talking about when you say someone is hot, but i'm also sexual, so don't think of me as like a prude or anything. Having said that, i have body issues and all kinds of insecurities, so it's not like i get around, either. I like making food but never really seem to have the time. I hide under blankets when i get worried. I stay up late because sometimes i have panic attacks while trying to fall asleep.</p>
                <p>If you speak <abbr title="Myers-Briggs Type Indicator">MBTI</abbr>, i'm an <abbr title="Introversion iNtuition Feeling Perception">INFP</abbr>, although a few years back i rated as an <abbr title="Introversion iNtuition Thinking Perception">INTP</abbr>. I didn't really get my identity stuff figured out until this past winter, and kinda hate the person i was before then. I still have some bad habits that i'm working to fix.</p>

            <section id="what">
                <h2>what did</h2>
                <p>I made this website, for one thing. Web design has been something of a hobby for me for like four years now and i like to think that i've gotten pretty good at it.</p>
                <p>I have a few projects going on right now <a href="https://github.com/literallybenjam" target="_blank">on <u>github</u></a>, so if you're into that sort of thing you can go there to see what i've been working on. Personally i find the <u>github</u> interface to be kinda hard to navigate if you don't know what you're looking for.</p>
                <p>I write media criticism, and i've set up a website called <a href="http://home.faint.xyz/" target="_blank"><u><i>FAINT.xyz</i></u></a> to post some of the things i've written. There's not a whole lot there right now because good criticism takes kinda a while to write. I'd like to update it more in the future, though.</p>
                <p>Recently i've started a playthrough of <u><i>Pokémon Y</i></u> and have been livetweeting/roleplaying my playthrough. You can get caught up on the story at <a href="http://pkmny.benjam.xyz" target="_blank">this website</a> and then follow along <a href="https://twitter.com/pkmny_leaf" target="_blank"><u>@pkmny_leaf</u></a>.</p>
                <p>I've also written some pieces on linguistics and some others of a more personal nature; those are uploaded somewhere around here. If you <a href="/texts/" target="_blank">look around</a>, i'm sure you'll find them.</p>
