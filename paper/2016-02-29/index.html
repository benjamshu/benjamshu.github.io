                <p>
                    So, <span data-news-metadata-url="http://www.hillaryclinton.com/" data-news-metadata-twitter="HillaryClinton" data-news-metadata-facebook="hillaryclinton" data-news-metadata-instagram="hillaryclinton" data-news-metadata-youtube="https://youtube.com/hillaryclinton" data-news-metadata-medium="@HillaryClinton">Hillary Clinton</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzvF-zrxAds" title="FULL - Hillary Clinton Speaks at Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York" target="_blank">gave a speech</a> <time datetime="2016-02-16" title="16 Feb 2016">two weeks ago</time> (transcript <a href="https://medium.com/hillary-for-america/breaking-down-barriers-for-african-americans-d444f1c568b6#.uo0ldof9k" title="Breaking down barriers for African Americans" target="_blank">here</a>) at the <span data-news-metadata-url="http://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg" data-news-metadata-twitter="schomburgcenter" data-news-metadata-facebook="Schomburgcenter" data-news-metadata-tumblr="schomburgcenter" data-news-metadata-youtube="http://www.youtube.com/user/theschomburgcenter">Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture</span>, and it was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/16/in-speech-on-ending-racism-hillary-clinton-offers-125-billion-plan-to-help-poor-minorities/" title="In Speech on Ending Racism, Hillary Clinton Offers $125 Billion Plan to Help Poor Minorities" target="_blank">kinda a big deal</a>.
                    Riffing on Bernie's emphasis on Wall Street, Hillary remarked that <q>there’s a lot more going on in our country that we should be concerned about.</q> Using the crisis in Flint as a launching-point for talking about larger issues of structural inequality, she enumerated many ways in which racism is still a problem in today's society. <q>For many white Americans, it’s tempting to believe that bigotry is largely behind us,</q> she said. <q>But more than half a century after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and John Lewis bled, race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>I’d be the first to admit I don’t have all the answers. I’ve made my own mistakes. I’ve walked my own journey. But I believe with all my heart we can and must do better. … So I’m proposing a comprehensive new commitment to equity and opportunity for African American communities.</q>
                    Hillary outlined a few steps of her plan for fighting racism in the US, and remarked that her plan was too extensive to meniton in full (she put the rest <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/racial-justice/" title="Racial Justice: America’s long struggle with race is far from finished." target="_blank">on her website</a>).
                    She then spoke out against white politicians deciding the agenda for political debate and taking minority votes for granted:
                    <q>If we’re serious about our commitment to the poor, to those who need some help, including African Americans, if we continue to ask black people to vote for us, we cannot minimize the realities of the lives they lead or take their concerns for granted.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    She ended the speech with a single request: <q>Hold me accountable.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's big.
                    In a <a href="https://thsppl.com/dear-hillary-420c30560714" title="Dear Hillary:" target="_blank">response to the speech</a> published on <span data-news-metadata-url="https://thsppl.com/" data-news-metadata-twitter="thsppl"><i>THOSE PEOPLE</i></span>, <span data-news-metadata-twitter="dominiquematti" data-news-metadata-medium="@DominiqueMatti">Dominique Matti</span> noted that Hillary's record is not exactly clean.
                    As First Lady under a presidency which signed into law many questionable acts impacting both racial minorities and queer lives, Hillary held a position of power and visibility which often failed to speak out meaningfully against important legislation.
                    And while the circumstances surrounding these events are complex, asking for accountability is an important first step to making amends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is especially significant regarding the history of her primary opponent, <span data-news-metadata-url="https://berniesanders.com/" data-news-metadata-twitter="BernieSanders" data-news-metadata-facebook="berniesanders" data-news-metadata-instagram="berniesanders" data-news-metadata-tumblr="berniesanders" data-news-metadata-youtube="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH1dpzjCEiGAt8CXkryhkZg">Bernie Sanders</span>.

You can hear <span data-news-metadata-twitter="joseiswriting" data-news-metadata-facebook="jav" data-news-metadata-instagram="joseiswriting" data-news-metadata-medium="@joseiswriting">Jose Antonio Vargas</span> give his thoughts on the first disruption in an interview <a href="https://soundcloud.com/latimes/interview-jose-antonio-vargas-on-netroots-nation" title="Interview: Jose Antonio Vargas on Netroots Nation" target="_blank">here</a>, and <span data-news-metadata-url="http://www.illdoctrine.com/" data-news-metadata-twitter="jsmooth995" data-news-metadata-youtube="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjj9EnVJUY7pTkP5MX8F9gQ">Jay Smooth</span> responding to common reactions from supporters after the second, below.

                    In a piece for <span data-news-metadata-url="http://www.mtv.com/" data-news-metadata-twitter="MTV" data-news-metadata-facebook="MTV" data-news-metadata-tumblr="mtv" data-news-metadata-youtube="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxAICW_LdkfFYwTqTHHE0vg">MTV</span> titled <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2745294/hillary-clinton-race-speech-harlem/" target="_blank"><i>The White Candidate's Burden</i></a>, <span data-news-metadata-twitter="JamilSmith" data-news-metadata-facebook="jamilksmith">Jamil Smith</span> chronicles the relationship black voters and white candidates have had in this past election, praising Hillary and condemning Bernie for their willingness to challenge whiteness in their pursuit of justice.
                    <q>[Sanders] certainly has the rhetoric down, demonstrating the fluency of someone who’s been reading about black death in the last few years… But he isn’t challenging white voters sufficiently to be part of the solution,</q> he remarks.
                    And although Hillary is far from perfect, <q>it seems Clinton at least grasps that she has progress to make.</q>

                    On <time datetime="2016-02-25" title="25 February 2016">Thursday</time>, Phil Bryant, governor of Mississippi, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/25/politics/mississippi-confederate-heritage-month/index.html" title="Mississippi governor defends Confederate Heritage Month decree" target="_blank">defended his proclamtion</a> of April as Confederate Heritage Month.
                    While designating the month as a time <q>to gain insight from our mistakes and successes,</q> the proclamation makes no mention of what those mistakes and successes might <em>be</em>, and as Mississippi is the only remaining State in the Union to feature the Confederate emblem in its state flag, the chances of the month being an educational moment are slim.
                    And while the Mississippi proclamation has made recent news, it is important to recognize that the commemoration <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_History_Month" title="Confederate History Month" target="_blank">is nothing new</a> for many Southern states.

                    In a recent piece published to Medium, <span data-news-metadata-url="http://patrissecullors.com/" data-news-metadata-twitter="osope" data-news-metadata-facebook="727718905" data-news-metadata-instagram="love_cullors">Patrisse Marie Cullors-Brignac</span> <a href="https://medium.com/@patrissemariecullorsbrignac/we-didn-t-start-a-movement-we-started-a-network-90f9b5717668" target="_blank">argues against her own positioning</a> as co-founder of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, remarking that <q>We didn't start a movement. We started a network.</q>
                    In the piece, Patrisse speaks out both against the depiction of <span data-news-metadata-url="http://blacklivesmatter.com/" data-news-metadata-twitter="bklivesmatter" data-news-metadata-facebook="blacklivesmatter" data-news-metadata-instagram="blklivesmatter" data-news-metadata-tumblr="blacklivesmatter">the #BlackLivesMatter organization</span> as a movement which begins and ends with its founders, and the culture of hostility that has sprung up in online spaces when discussing racial justice.
