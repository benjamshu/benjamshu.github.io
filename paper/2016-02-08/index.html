                    Some dudes with pretty not-okay views planned meetups in several cities only to be very publicly shamed and harrased as a result.
                    Normally not the sort of thing I would speak about, except that Lindy West wrote a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/07/daryush-roosh-v-valizadeh-and-his-acolytes-pilloried" title="Now Roosh V and his band of sad men in dark rooms know how it feels to be bombarded with bile" target="_blank">pretty decent response</a> on <i>The Guardian</i>.
                    The TL:DR;?
                    Don't harrass people.
                    Also don't be a shitty dude.

                    The superbowl happened (Broncos won).

                    Beyonc√© released a new music video, and there was some debate about some of the footage, which came from <a href="https://vimeo.com/58423297" title="That B.E.A.T." target="_blank">this documentary</a> and was used apparently without permission.
                    As it turned out, the filmmakers didn't own the footage, as the documentary was commissioned by Nokia and Sundance, who granted permission and were given compensation for its use.
                    Moral of the story: work-for-hire copyright regulations can be a butt.

                    As a part of pre-registration this past year, Whitman College students were <a href="http://whitmanpioneer.com/news/2016/01/28/gender-pronoun-selection/" title="Gender pronoun selection now included in registration" target="_blank">asked for their preferred name and pronouns</a>, a change set in motion by <a href="http://goaswc.org/SRS15-5/" title="A Resolution to Incorporate Respect for Preferred Gender Pronouns into the Whitman Experience" target="_blank"><i>Resolution SRS15.5</i></a>, passed by the Associated Students of Whitman College at the end of last year.
                    Although I have mixed feelings about the ways in which pronoun selection forces queer-identified individuals to situate themselves within a dyadicocisnormative rhetorical binary (<span class="footnote">and quantify themselves as data bodies<span class="note">See Jasbir Puar, <i>Terrorist Assemblages</i></span></span>), being able to choose the manner in which you are represented and made visible is important, and I think that this move is a step forward.

                    I read a lot of books for my thesis, and the latest, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300166311/danah-20" target="_blank"><i>It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens</i></a>, is a gem.
                    It's targeted at an adult demographic, which means sometimes you might find yourself rolling your eyes and saying <q>well, <em>duh</em>,</q> but it takes on the dynamics of teen life in a digital age surprisingly well.
                    From a theoretical standpoint, its conceptualization of social media as an interconnected structure of <i>networked publics</i> is super useful, and its distinction between "being public" and "being <em>in</em> public" is a crucial one.
                    Privacy becomes less something you <em>have</em> than something you <em>do</em>, in a landscape where surveillance is everywhere and visibility is only sometimes opt-out (and rarely, if ever, opt-in).
