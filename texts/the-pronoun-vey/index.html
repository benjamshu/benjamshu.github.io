            <p>This is pretty much what it says in the title: I'm introducing a new pronoun; the lemma-form is <i>vey</i>. If that's all you care about, i recommend skipping to <a href="#vey">the end</a>. However, due to the nature of the subject, there are a few other things i feel obligated to say first. Nongendred pronoun proposals these days seem to be met with a lot of questions and criticism, so the bulk of this essay will be addressing those not-really-questions and various concerns. If you still want to get ahold of me after all that, my twitter handle is in the header.</p>

                <h2>let's talk about gendre</h2>
                <p>Due to the eroticization of the word <i>sex</i> in the twentieth century and <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gender&amp;allowed_in_frame=0" target="_blank">the cultural decision to use <i>gendre</i> as a replacement</a>, we generally think of grammatical gendre in terms of masculine versus feminine, and yeah, this is how some languages treat the concept. However, in many proto&ndash;indo-european languages, there are actually three gendres: <b><i>masculine</i></b>, <b><i>feminine</i></b>, and what is traditionally called <i>neuter</i> but often is better described as <b><i>inanimate</i></b>. We can see this distinction in our third-person singular personal pronouns: <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, and <i>it</i>.</p>
                <p>Given the modern connotations and understandings of the word <i>gendre</i>, it is tempting to think of it as a means of classification, but when talking about <em>grammatical</em> gendre (which pre-dates the more modern concept), it is important to recognize that this function is only secondary. Some languages do have features with this function; they are referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_class" target="_blank">noun classes</a> or the aptly-named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_(linguistics)" target="_blank">classifiers</a></p>
                <p>What sets grammatical gendre apart from these sorts of features, though, is the matter of <em>agreement</em>. Strictly defined, grammatical gendre is used to link constituents, either determiners and adjectives to nouns (compare spanish <i lang="es">un libro</i> and <i lang="es">una llave</i>) or pronouns to antecedents. In descendents of <u>protoâ€“indo-european</u>, gendre serves less as a means of putting words into boxes (categorize), than as a way of marking links between words. This explains is why many languages assign grammatical gendre to objects with no inherent cultural gendre traits. The femininity of <i lang="es">llave</i>, in <u>spanish</u>, is as a <em>result</em> of the fact that it is modified by feminine-marked adjectives, <strong>not the other way around.</strong></p>
                <p>This, of course, begs the question as to why gendre has such strong connotations if it is simply a grammatical word-linking process, and one explanation is that the associated meanings of gendre emerged as a sort of memory-aid. To use our previous example in <u>spanish</u>, remembering that <i lang="es">llave</i> goes with <i>-a</i> can be somewhat tedious; on the other hand, associating <i lang="es">llave</i> (<i>key</i>) with femininity is relatively easy. Then, if we can just recall that <em>all</em> feminine things (with a few exceptions, perhaps) use <i>-a</i> endings, we're set. And so grammatical gendre becomes gendred, so to speak.</p>
                <p>The point is, grammatical gendre <em>does</em> serve a purpose: It clarifies the link between constituents. To demonstrate this, consider the following sentence in <u>spanish</u>: <i lang="es">Saca el libro y la llave; ponlo en la mesa y ponla en la mochila</i> (<i>Get the book and the key; put it on the table and put it in the backpack</i>). In <u>english</u>, it is impossible to know what each <i>it</i> in the sentence refers to, but in <u>spanish</u>, the difference between <i lang="en">ponlo</i> and <i lang="en">ponla</i> clarifies that the first refers to the book, and the second to the key.</p>
                <p>Here's the catch, though: Grammatical gendre may serve a purpose, but in <u>english</u>, <strong>gendre isn't grammatical</strong>. There are no formal grammatical rules which state when you must use <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, or <i>it</i>; the difference between these words is lexical, in their meanings, not in where you can use them. As an example, referring to a person with <i>it</i> isn't <em>ungrammatical</em>, it's just, well, offensive.</p>
                <p>As perhaps another way of looking at things, consider the <u>english</u> honorifics <i>miss</i> and <i>mrs</i>. There are lexical rules for when you should use one or the other, certainly, but to think of <i>miss</i> and <i>mrs</i> as belonging to different <em>gendres</em> is silly. You will note that <em>this</em> binary already has an invented ambiguous third-form&mdash;and <i>he</i> and <i>she</i> relate in exactly the same way.</p>

            <section id="what">
                <h2>so gendre isn't grammatical, so what?</h2>
                <p>This is important because it makes the process of creating a nongendred pronoun remarkably easy. In <u>french</u> or <u>spanish</u>, removing gendre from the language is an impossible task, but in <u>english</u>, it's completely reasonable. This isn't a matter of restructuring our grammars, it's a case of there-isn't-a-word-for-this-thing-i-want-to-express. Fortunately, the english language is very well suited to handle this sort of situation: If there isn't a word for what we want to express, <a href="http://www.americandialect.org/woty/all-of-the-words-of-the-year-1990-to-present" target="_blank">we just make one up</a>.</p>
                <p>And <em>yet</em>. To date, no nongendred pronoun has emerged with wide acceptance. There is certainly need&mdash;legal texts and academic papers are chock-full of unweildy <i>he-or-she</i>s; gendre theorists curse the binary that these two words create&mdash;and there have <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:List_of_protologisms/third_person_singular_gender_neutral_pronouns" target="_blank">certainly been attempts</a>, but so far none have stuck on a large scale. And maybe this is not a bad thing&mdash;we certainly don't all have to use the <em>same</em> nongendred pronoun, this is <u>english</u>, for crying out loud&mdash;but the hope is that we all have <em>some</em> option that we feel comfortable using.</p>
                <p>This proposal exists because i was not satisfied with the preexisting pronoun options available to me. It certainly has its strengths and weaknesses, and i am not about to claim that the pronoun that someone else is using is <em>wrong</em> or that mine is objectively better or whatever. It is better-suited for me, but that's not the same as better-suited for everyone.</p>

            <section id="vey">
                <h2><i>vey</i>: the pronoun</h2>
                <p>This proposal exists to establish <i>vey</i> as a nongendred pronoun for use in the english language. The pronoun comes in a variety of forms, as follows: <i>vey</i> (nominative), <i>ve</i> (objective), <i>vy</i> (possessive determiner), <i>vyn</i> (possessive pronoun), <i>vyself</i> (reflexive). Its design features the following strengths:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The declension <i>vey</i>/<i>ve</i>/<i>vy</i>/<i>vyn</i> phonetically mirrors the declension <i>i</i>/<i>me</i>/<i>my</i>/<i>mine</i> and <i>thou</i>/<i>thee</i>/<i>thy</i>/<i>thine</i></li>
                    <li>The lemma (nominative) form, <i>vey</i>, is phonetically similar to that of the third-person <em>plural</em> pronoun, <i>they</i>, but distinct enough to avoid confusion</li>
                    <li>The inital <i>v</i> sound of <i>vey</i> occurs in the same region of mouth as the other personal pronouns: <i>me</i>, <i>we</i>, <i>thou</i>, <i>they</i></li>
                    <li><i>Vey</i> is not in any way secondary to or derived from the existing <i>he</i>/<i>she</i> binary. It exists not as an alternative to <i>he</i> or <i>she</i> but as a replacement</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The big problem, in my mind, with most invented nongendred pronouns is that they tend to try to mirror <i>he</i> and <i>she</i>, the very pronouns that they seek to replace. Why not, instead, model them after the pronouns that we intend to keep? <i>Vey</i> takes this approach, departing fully from the gendre binary while maintaining a diverse yet familiar&mdash;and easy-to-remember&mdash;set of forms.</p>
                <p>That's pretty cool, yo. Check it out.</p>
