                    <h2>introduction</h2>
                    <p>Hugely important in the realm of linguistics is the distinction btwn <i>prescriptivism</i> and <i>descriptivism</i>. <dfn>Prescriptivism</dfn> aims to tell ppl how to speak + write, the schoolteacher drilling students on what is and is not "proper". This has been shown to be the height of arrogance, one culture exerting its will on others, excluding and erasing those voices who exist outside of the normative conception of the language. Instead, lingustics tends to favour a <dfn>descriptivist</dfn> approach, describing the features and usages of a language without passing judgement. Impartial, objective, unbiased.</p>
                    <p>Yeah, right.</p>
                    <p><strong>Language is inherently political.</strong> By speaking in a certain dialect, with a certain set of rules, you implicitly endorse those rules as being "right" ("correct"). And that's cool, yo&mdash;the way you speak <em>is</em> right. But when the vast majority of the written word follows the same sets of rules, they are codified as the "proper" or "acceptable" way of doing things. <strong>Language is, by its very nature, prescriptive</strong>, and ignoring this fact only serves to reinforce the current erasure of voices by the power structures of modern society.</p>
                    <p><strong><i>#altlang</i> seeks to radically alter the linguistic landscape by forcibly rejecting normative preconceptions of what language can, and should, be.</strong> Within each language, there are a multitude of dialects, accents, variations, differences between spoken and written forms, and these variations, dialects, and languages exist not as separate entities but as intermingling structures within the vast overarching system. <i>#altlang</i> celebrates these differences, rejecting common classifications of manner and purpose, questioning the origins and accessibility of "formal language", promoting creativity and personality not only in word choice but within the linguistic structures themselves.</p>

                <section id="principles">
                    <h2>principles</h2>
                    <p>To this end, this manifesto (not-so-)humbly proposes the following principles:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Language is inherently political, and by its very nature prescriptive. Complacency with norms implicitly supports and perpetuates their existence.</li>
                        <li>There is no "right way" to speak or write within a language. Diversity in language is important and should be celebrated.</li>
                        <li>Current normative conceptions of language serve to erase voices which exist outside of their expectations. This is bad and should be resisted.</li>
                        <li>To define language is to restrict and repress it. <i><u>#altlang</u></i> refers not to a specific dialect or way of speaking but to the plurality of languages and their implementations. <i><u>#altlang</u></i> has no static definition and can be used by anyone adhering to the broad concepts of the term.</li>
                        <li>These <u><i>principles</i></u> exist within a historical and political context and should not be taken as being beyond critique or revision. Language is defined by its speakers, not by a list of rules in a book.</li>
                    </ol>

                <section id="advancement">
                    <h2>advancing <u><i>the #altlang manifesto</i></u></h2>
                    <p>At this time of writing, much of academia still holds on to antiquated concepts of "formal writing" which serve to advantage those peeps raised in middle-to-upper-class white intellectual culture and ignore or disparage ppl from more diverse contexts or backgrounds. Most publications follow style guides which serve to perpetuate preconceived notions of proper speech and writing, and popular novels and nonfiction do little to stray from this path. On television and radio, newscasters and talk show hosts align themselves with normative dialects while deviations are often utilized to suggest ignorance and incompatibility with mainstream thought.</p>
                    <p>At first, a delicate balancing act must be made between challenging normative conceptions of language and retaining enough normative structure to be heard and granted legitimacy by the systems of power extant in modern society. In addition to challenging directly the preconceived notions of "proper language", we must pave the way for others by signal-boosting and showing support for those who exist outside of these structures, whose voices would otherwise be lost. We must demonstrate that opposition to linguistic normativity is feasible, practicable, and beneficial before society-as-a-whole will turn inward to analyse the systems it has been complicit in nurturing for so long.</p>
