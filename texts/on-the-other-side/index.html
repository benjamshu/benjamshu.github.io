                    <h2>introduction</h2>
                    <p>This is an essay about the word <i>trans</i>, its deployment, trans individuals, sex, and the terminology surrounding these ideas. There is a strong tendency when writing these sorts of works&mdash;at least for me, there is&mdash;to take a prescriptivist approach, to say <q>ok, let me just tell an entire class of historically oppressed ppl how they should identify themselves</q>. Obviously, this is problematic.</p>
                    <p>But what i <em>can</em> do&mdash;and will attempt to do, over the course of this essay, is describe my <em>own</em> experiences, and then perhaps relate those to larger systems and structures. What "seems wrong" to me, about the current state of terminology regarding trans individuals, and why? How can these problems be rectified? These are the questions i will seek to answer.</p>
                    <p>Part of my reason in writing this, though, is that i <em>do</em> find some aspects of current terminology to be problematic. In my analysis i will undoubtedly critique and call into question some of the terminology and identities that many trans people today live by. But acknowledging that a term is problematic is not to say that it should no longer find use; rather, it calls attention to the fact that the <em>ways</em> in which the term is deployed are important, that we should&mdash;well, here i am sounding prescriptive again.</p>
                    <p>The fact of the matter is that i am in no way an expert or authority on matters of trans terminology or identity, and i certainly don't speak for anyone else, much less any larger community, when i make my points. This essay springs from my personal experiences and my conclusions find their origins within that context&mdash;yr milage may vary.</p>

                <section id="history">
                    <h2>a brief history</h2>
                    <p>I'm going to start this essay with a history&mdash;not a history of the terminology itself; i am hardly qualified to write such a thing&mdash;but a history of my understanding thereof. My first encounter with <i>trans-</i>, as a prefix, was in elementary school, in the context of <i>transcontinental railroad</i>; in the sense of <i>transsexual</i> or <i>transgendre</i>, i didn't really encounter such terms until college. The way it was explained to me my freshman year: <i>transsexual</i> was a term for ppl who had taken steps to change their bodies to match their identities, and <i>transgendre</i> was a term for ppl who hadn't.</p>
                    <p>I immediately found these terms problematic; at the time i didn't have the language or self-understanding to articulate the differences between <i>sex</i> and <i>gendre</i>, but i knew that such a distinction existed and that substituting the two wasn't ideal (more on this later). However, i was soon introduced to another term, <i>trans*</i>, which was intended to be a little more inclusive; the asterisk, as i understand, was later dropped because it caused more problems than it solved.</p>
                    <p>In providing this history i have danced around the topic of what <i>trans</i> actually <em>means</em>&mdash;this is intentional. Part of my reason for doing this is because <i>trans</i> is one of those terms that perhaps works better without a formal definition; another is that my definition of <i>trans</i> will be reworked over the course of this essay. I will, however, make two brief points about it before moving on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><i>Trans</i> is internal, not external.</strong> <i>Trans</i> does not refer to the current state of one's "sex organs" (lol yr entire body is a sex organ); while trans individuals may experience body dysphoria, this is an internal reaction to external factors, not an external circumstance in-and-of-itself.</li>
                        <li><strong><i>Trans</i> deals with sex, not gendre.</strong> Gendre is far from a binary system, and as such the application of <i>trans</i>/<i>cis</i> terminology to it is problematic. Furthermore, the experience of being, say, a butch female, arguably "transgendre", is different (no value judgements here) than that of being a trans male. Again, this will be clarified in later sections.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are probably those who will disagree with even my minor points above, but for the purposes of this essay, let us proceed with those statements in mind.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="sex">
                    <h2>defining <i>sex</i></h2>
                    <p>We are taught&mdash;well, at least, <em>i</em> was&mdash;that sex, unlike gendre, is something innate in a person&mdash;or, at least, in a person's body; even in circles of queer and trans theory, we see phrases like <i>male-bodied</i> and <i>female-bodied</i> crop up from time to time. This implies, of course, that there is an essence to a male or female body that it is possible to possess, that these two things are somehow distinct from each other. Another phrase oft tossed around is <i>biological sex</i>, as if the fact that the term is connected to science somehow mitigates its problematic nature. And yet so it is proposed, that <dfn>sex</dfn> (especially the "biological" variety) is determined by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the chromosomal makeup of an individual (seriously, what? is this something we <em>ever know</em>?)</li>
                        <li>the hormonal makeup of an individual (likewise difficult to discover in many cases)</li>
                        <li>the presence/lack in an individual of one or more of the various organs that our culture has defined as sexual in nature (penis, uterus, testicles, vagina…)</li>
                        <li>the presence/lack in an individual of one or more of the so-called "secondary sex charactersitics" (facial hair, developed breasts…)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are some who would argue that these definitions come from a sort of objective this-is-the-nature-of-the-world scientific approach, that reproductive differentiation exists in many species (including humans), and that it is this differentiation that we have given the name <i>sex</i>. This explanation presumes that sex is reproductive in nature; as i think is fairly self-evident at this point (and the existence of the trans individual only serves to verify), it is not. It is important to realize that the criterion listed above, and any valuations or weights placed upon them, are arbitrary and socially constructed. Biology itself, after all, is a social construction; we <em>invented</em> biology.</p>
                    <p>Instead of focusing, as we have, on ways in which sex is assigned to individuals by others, i want to instead focus on the way sex is perceived by individuals within themselves. I turn now to a quote by <u>mira bellwether</u> in <a href="https://payhip.com/b/hRtK" target="_blank">issue #0 of the zine <u><i>Fucking Trans Women</i></u></a>:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>…It makes explaining my situation slightly more difficult when I have to add that, in addition to being a transsexual, I am not actually interested in changing my genitals at all.</p>
                        <p>And it makes my life more difficult that what I have between my legs is not just a penis, it's a woman's penis. That's something that took me a little while to put into words, but those are the right words. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder;">My body is a woman's body and part of it is my penis</span>, a woman's penis…</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>What if there was&mdash;what if we <em>allow there to be</em>&mdash;such a thing as a male vulva, a female penis&mdash;organs which, indeed, might be from the outside entirely indistinguisable from their counterparts in the other sex? What if we allow the sex of an individual to be determined not by the form of vy body but rather by the relationship that body had to its owner? What if&mdash;to make things personal&mdash;what if my body was female because my relationship to it is that of a female to hers, and for no other reason?</p>
                    <p>Well, why not?</p>
                    <p>(It is important to note that, for many trans individuals, this relationship often involves some level of body dysphoria; it is also important to note that, for all individuals, this relationship need not be strictly defined. My body is female because it is female <em>to me</em>, and there need not be any higher authority than that.)</p>
                    <p>This conception of sex seems like a relatively simple one on the surface, but it radically changes many approaches to trans individuals and their bodies. No longer does <i>male-bodied</i> or <i>female-bodied</i> imply anything about the form or function of the bodies in question; no longer are trans bodies defined in terms of <q>what's downstairs</q>; suddenly, phrases like <i>sexual reassignment therapy</i> sound incredibly menacing.</p>
                    <p>It is at this point whether some readers might begin questioning the very existence of sex as a concept&mdash;if sex is not defined by the body, can such a thing even be said to exist? To which my answer is yes, of course it can, as i (and, i'm sure, many other trans individuals) am reminded on a constant basis. My body is not male&mdash;more than that, it is female&mdash;such a thing as sex exists.</p>

                <section id="gendre">
                    <h2>sex and gendre: some problems with trans terminology</h2>
                    <p>It is now&mdash;now that we have a definition of sex which is <em>not</em> solely determined by external factors&mdash;it is now that i feel comfortable bringing in the concept of gendre. For sex and gendre have had a troubling past, and this is doubly true with respect to trans individuals and identifications. The idea that sex is purely physical and gendre is purely mental&mdash;this very idea that we challenge with our new way of looking at sex&mdash;has long been employed in trans terminology; one need only look to the terms <i>transsexual</i> and <i>transgendre</i> to see that this is the case. But sex, as i held in my <a href="#history">history</a>, is not gendre; i will take a moment here to breifly clarify this distinction.</p>
                    <p>Sex, as we have discussed, is defined by the relationship one has to vy own body; it is an entirely internal force, invisible to those on the outside. Gendre we speak of in terms of roles, it is performed and perceived, it is a presentation of sorts. Gendre is only tangentially related to the body; sex could not exist without it.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, we continue to see gendre employed in discussing trans individuals where perhaps sex is intended: the phrases <i>trans man</i> and <i>trans woman</i>, for example. While i see no problem with men who are also trans taking the intersectional identity of <i>trans man</i> upon themselves, these terms are also often applied to others with nary a thought as to their applicability. If you are female and trans, you are a woman; if you are male and trans, you must be a man (note that there is zero degree of flexibility here: the phrase <i>masculine trans individual</i> is hardly ever uttered).</p>
                    <p>We ought to know better than that. As a female who is trans, i also consider myself nongendred in my identity and somewhat butch in my expression. I reject the word <i>woman</i> in its entirety, despite the fact that, if others were to describe me, that might be the language they would choose.</p>

                <section id="imposed-sex">
                    <h2>imposed sex and the meaning of <i>trans</i></h2>
                    <p>There is another question which has escaped our grasp, one that deals with the nature of <i>trans</i> itself; i will phrase it thusly: If sex is defined not by one's body but by one's relation to it, then what does it mean to be trans? Traditionally, the definition for trans relied on a discord between one's imagined sex and its physical manifestation&mdash;terms which under our new definition no longer make sense. Similarly, it has been defined as a conflict between the sex one was assigned at birth and the sex with which one identifies&mdash;but to most trans individuals, i think&mdash;certainly, to myself&mdash;the oppressive nature of society extends far beyond that which is said at birth.</p>
                    <p>Instead, i propose this refiguring of the trans identity, if only because it is how i view myself: to be <dfn>trans</dfn> is to have not one sex but two, the first being that natural relationship most ppl have with their bodies, and the second, in perpetual conflict with the first, one imposed on oneself by society. This refiguring of trans defines it not as a deviation from the assumed norm but as an imposed complication to one's natural perception of self. I am trans not because i am a female with a penis, but because i am a female upon which the idea of maleness has been imposed.</p>
                    <p>This imposition is not without consequence. I have been raised as male&mdash;more importantly, i have been raised to <em>think</em> of myself as male&mdash;and this flawed self-perception serves to both repress and alientate. When i feel body dysphoria&mdash;and i do, sometimes&mdash;it often is sourced in a fear that my body does not reflect my sex, that when others see me, they will see <i>male</i> as opposed to <i>female</i>. I do not fear this because i care about what others think of me&mdash;or, if i do, this is a lesser fear&mdash;no, what i truly fear is that this perception by others will serve to reinforce an internal impression by myself, that if everyone else thinks i am male, so will i. It is this constant conflict, between my sex and the sex imposed upon me by social expectation, that is my source of discomfort and self-alienation.</p>

                <section id="restriction">
                    <h2>restricting the self; restricting the other</h2>
                    <p>In linguistics&mdash;and forgive me for making a sidetrack here, but i believe this is relevant&mdash;in linguistics there is a distinction made between adjectives which are <b>restrictive</b> and those which are <b>non-restrictive</b>. The distinction is best made with an example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>in <i>i want the red pen</i>, the word <i>red</i> is <dfn>restrictive</dfn>, because it serves to restrict the types of pens that the subject desires</li>
                        <li>in <i>the pen i received was red</i>, the word <i>red</i> is <dfn>non-restrictive</dfn>, because it expands or clarifies our understanding of the pen in question</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is of little doubt to me that the word <i>trans</i>, as it is deployed in phrases such as <i>trans woman</i> and <i>trans man</i> (or perhaps the more fanciful <i>trans female</i> and <i>trans male</i>), is of the first variety. To be a trans man is to be more than simply a man who is trans; <i>trans man</i> is an identity, a specific variety of manhood, a restriction upon the very idea of <i>man</i> itself.</p>
                    <p>This is perhaps belabouring the point, but to bring things into a more modern context, consider the hashtags <i>#TransMenAreMen</i> and <i>#TransWomenAreWomen</i>. The restrictive nature of <i>trans</i> in this case is clearly demonstrated through simple comparison: consider <i>men who happen to be trans are men</i>. The positioning of <i>trans</i> within the relative clause allows for its easy elision: <i>men … are men</i>, a tautology, the logic of which is undeniable to the point of painful redundancy.</p>
                    <p>The word <i>trans</i>, taken outside of the concept of sex, is roughly defined as meaning <i>on the other side</i>. In using phrasing such as <i>trans male</i> and <i>trans female</i>, we are restricting the idea of one's natural sex by defining it in opposition to the imposed; we are, quite literally, defining it as the <u>other</u>.</p>
                    <p>As a female trans individual, it is not the <em>female</em> part of my identity that needs qualification, restriction, further definition, a keeping in check, but the male. For it is the nature of my circumstance that i must inhabit both&mdash;not as a male who wishes to become female, but as a female who is forced to simultaneously view herself as male. And so i propose a shift, a movement away from the qualification and restriction of our "true" sexes, and, in the case of trans individuals, towards the restriction, subjugation&mdash;and yes, acknowledgement, ownership&mdash;of the sex which society has cast on us.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that the word <i>trans</i> cannot transcend this initial reading, or that it is useless&mdash;obviously, i have used it throughout this essay. But i think it is important that we stop, or, at least, become more conscious of, restricting and repressing the natural sex of trans individuals for the benefit of the sex imposed upon them. I am a female, who people expect to be male; it is my maleness, not my femaleness, that is truly <q>on the other side</q> of the truth.</p>
