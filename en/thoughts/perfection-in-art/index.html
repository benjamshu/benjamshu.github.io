                    <h1>perfection in art</h1>
                    <p>this is basically a really long essay on why i can't draw… whatever, enjoy | <a href="http://twitter.com/literallybenjam">@literallybenjam</a></p>
                </header>
                <p>I'm not sure when "perfection" and "accuracy" started mattering to me in terms of the art i made&mdash;and to clarify, this <em>is</em> about the art i make, not that which i consume; i enjoyed <u><i>Ratatouille</i></u>, and as far as i'm aware, rats can't talk&mdash;the concern certainly wasn't there in elementary school, what with my fantastical tales of wizards with outlandish names like <u>pot ether</u> and <u>Dimond Alexandrite</u>; it didn't seem to be present in middle school, when i was busy writing <u><i>Twilight Princess</i></u> fanfic and passing notes with friends; but by the tenth grade, it was definitely there.</p>
                <p>I blame my upbringing in mathematics. There's a kind of clarity in numbers, a certain precision, a clear difference between right and wrong… Given a line and a point not on it, how many parallel lines can you construct? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry" target="_blank">Zero…</a> No, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry" target="_blank">one.</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry" target="_blank">Maybe more?</a> Never mind that; take one look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28mathematical_constant%29" target="_blank"><u><u>Euler</u>'s number</u></a> and we can talk about just exactly how "precise" math can ever really be.</p>
                <p>Maybe it was technology that did it, the binary <u>1</u> and <u>0</u>, the ability to reduce everything into algorithms and logic; maybe it was science, with it's claims of a rational explanation for everything and some kind of objective truth. Sorry, math, i take back what i said: i blame <u>the enlightenment</u>.</p>

                <p>However it happened, though: There i was, tenth grade, with a massive story idea on my mind and an <em>obsession</em> with making everything as realistic as possible. Don't get me wrong, it was a fantasy story about people with magical powers… but the magic had very clearly defined rules, and wasn't really magic so much as a slightly different understanding of the way matter and energy worked, and of course since these people weren't on <u>earth</u> they wouldn't speak earth-languages, so i had to <a href="http://home.benjam.xyz/langdev/en/!DEPRECIATED!/7c" target="_blank">create my own</a>, and the animals probably would have evolved differently too, and i wonder how the different landforms would affect weather patterns, and what trees would be native to this island here…</p>
                <p>Now, this isn't a problem in and of itself&mdash;well, it means more work for me, but that's my own damn fault&mdash;it doesn't matter to the <em>reader</em> whether or not i know that the great tree before them is an oak that first sprouted in 1789 and that it has survived three different fires and that there is a robin's nest in the upper branches that has been abandoned for some time. So long as i am selective about how much of that information i actually reveal, so long as i can gloss over the unimportant stuff and don't bore the reader to death, what <em>i</em> know doesn't really matter. It's what i <em>say</em> that counts.</p>
                <p>I like to think that&mdash;in art, at least&mdash;everything happens for a reason. When that character stops to bow in front of that great tree, i like to think that it is because of some larger significance, some intent on the part of the creator, and, as a consumer, i like to try to devise for myself what that intent might have been. This kind of speculation and interpretation is, to me, what gives art much of its power. And this is the area where i, as a media creator, can excel: Because i know <em>way more</em> than i am letting on, it is easy for me to add these sorts of moments to a work, and so long as i can keep my mouth shut, i can leave things open for my audience to interpret and reinterpret, and make things personal. In other words, i have an obsession with <em>knowing</em> information, but i don't mind withholding it.</p>
                <p>…But, even so, there are some areas where this isn't quite enough, and this is where i really start to struggle. Enter, the visual arts. The visual arts are different from those of a more literary nature in that, while in literature you can get away with simply withholding information, in visual arts you have to actively <em>lie</em>. I'm not good at this. I'm not good at the lying part.</p>
                <p>Take a simple market scene. Already, i am lying to you, because this is not a market, it's a bunch of pixels on your screen! And it isn't 3-D, it's flat! And then look at this person… Are those dots supposed to be eyes? And those feet! They're triangles!</p>
                <p>Again, this is solely in reference to <em>the art i can create</em>. Other people can have triangle-feet and that's fine; it's just when <em>my</em> characters have them that <q>oh, no</q>. The point is, visual arts force me to sometimes place those eyeballs a little higher on <u>shizuku</u>'s head, when i know damn well they should be in the middle like they are on everyone else.</p>
                <p>This is, of course, only made more severe with <em>digital</em> visual arts, where everything can be calculated down to a pixel, and the colours fit into mathematically-defined colour spaces&mdash;you mean, i'm just supposed to pick colours that <em>look good together??!?!!</em> BUT HOW DO I KNOW? (hint: use your eyes). And then we get into things like vector drawing or 3-D animation, with vertices and coordinates and… Well, if you thought i said <q>oh, no</q> before, let me tell you.</p>
                <p>I don't like perfection. Perfection is boring; perfection is predictable; perfection sure as hell ain't human. And it's not so much the nature of being imperfect as the how that intrigues me&mdash;what compromises you are willing to make; where you invest your limited time and resources; what bits of personal experience and humanity bleed onto your work despite your best efforts to stop them. I guess, because i already know myself (hah, what a lie), it's just when <em>i</em> do it that it doesn't interest me, that i see it as a flaw, and myself as a failure.</p>
                <p>In the eleventh grade, i decided i would teach myself how to draw. Since the beginning, i was obsessed with getting anatomy right and being "realistic" and "accurate", and as a result have yet to really develop my own style. I'm still not very good.</p>
