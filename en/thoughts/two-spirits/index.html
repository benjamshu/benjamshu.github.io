                    <h2>introduction</h2>
                    <p>So, first day of classes, i'm sitting in my <u><i>Queer Religiosities</i></u> class, and after going over usual syllabus <s>bullshit</s> very important information, we watch this film titled <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1296906/" target="_blank"><u><i>Two Spirits</i></u></a>. To quote <u>IMDb</u>:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Filmmaker Lydia Nibley explores the cultural context behind a tragic and senseless murder. Fred Martinez was a Navajo youth slain at the age of 16 by a man who bragged to his friends that he 'bug-smashed a fag'. But Fred was part of an honored Navajo tradition - the 'nadleeh', or 'two-spirit', who possesses a balance of masculine and feminine traits. Through telling Fred's story, Nibley reminds us of the values that America's indigenous peoples have long embraced.</p>

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Now, this quote doesn't <em>quite</em> do the film justice&mdash;yes, it is about <u>Fred Martinez</u>, but it also takes a (small) look into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit" target="_blank">two-spirit</a> cultures and communities in general. And while this "review" is largely a criticism, i'm sure the film has its fair share of redeemable qualities&mdash;for one thing, my professor thought it suitable enough for class, and i trust her judgement. <strong><em>However</em></strong>, there are a few things that i, being me, found rather aggrevating about the film, and i'm taking the time to elaborate on them here not because i want to bash <u><i>Two Spirits</i></u> in particular, but because i think they are indicitive of some larger problems in the ways that our society tells queer narratives like this one. I'm not angry at the film, i'm angry at society. Well, maybe also a little at the film. But because society.</p>

                    <h2>before we begin: a few quick notes</h2>
                    <p>The first matter of business to attend to before starting a <s>rant</s> discussion like this is terminology. I'm going to use the term <i>queer</i> many times in this essay; this word was not used (hardly?) at all in the film and i feel it is important to clarify that i mean it in the broadest sense possible. When i say <i>queer</i>, i mean <i>non-conforming to modern western normativity</i>, especially as related to the concepts of sex, gendre, and sexuality (non-white&ndash;ness can be a factor intersectionally, but is not, for the purposes of this "essay", in-and-of-itself queer). I do <strong>not</strong> mean it as an identity category (not that identifying as <i>queer</i> is bad). <i>Two-spirit</i> will only be used in the contexts in which it was utilized by the film&mdash;i'm not nearly experienced enough in those circles to know what would be proper usage otherwise. The "main character" of the story, <u>Fred Martinez</u>, will be referred to with grammatically masculine pronouns as he was in the film. A cursory look through <u>wikipedia</u> tells me that <u>navajo</u> has no grammatical gendre, and it is important to note that, in indo-european languages such as <u>english</u>, the link between grammatical gendre and gendre identity is often dubious anyway.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, it is important to put this film into a frame of reference: it was made in 2009, airing on <u>PBS</u>'s <u><i>Independent Lens</i></u>, and the world has changed a bit since then. Some of my critiques might be affected by the fact that i am viewing this film under a different context than was originally anticipated; while this doesn't make my impressions less valid, it may perhaps make their causes more excusable.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, that nothing i say here is in any means a master stoke of genius on my part. All of this has been said before, i'm just re-hashing it in the context of this specific film&mdash;or, rather, using this film as an exuse to re-hash. Just because it's been said before doesn't mean it isn't still true, and when you gotta rant you gotta rant.</p>
                    <p>Fourthly, please note that while i may get very frustrated at some of the methods employed by the film and am certainly quite upset about the culture that we live in, these criticisms of culture and idea are abstract in nature and not directed specifically or solely at the film, its creators, or anyone involved. Furthermore, the fact that i am noting problematic aspects of this film does not mean that others cannot find value in it, or that that value is somehow diminished by the cultural context in which it was made and presently exists. I'm not here to bash on a movie&mdash;or on you for enjoying it, if that be the case&mdash;but to call out society on some of its flaws and assumptions.</p>
                    <p>Having said that, let's begin.</p>

                <section id="grievances">
                    <h2>a list of grievances</h2>
                    <p>Here's a brief overview of what i found problematic in this film, just to give you a sense of where we're going. More in-depth analysis, of course, follows.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>for a film about the life and&mdash;well, really mostly death&mdash;of a young&mdash;i hesitate to say <i>boy</i>, but <i>kid</i> sounds so demeaning&mdash;<em>person</em>, we learn surprisingly little about him as such</li>
                        <li>the film follows in a long tradition of viewing queer non-whites solely by their queerness and non-white&ndash;ness, which is hella problematic</li>
                        <li>the point of the film is either:<ul>
                            <li>to tell the story of a kid/teenager who got murdered, which it fails at (see my first grievance)</li>
                            <li>to inform the viewers about two-spirit identities and culture, in which case one wonders why it chose to focus on one very specific story as our only real glimpse into that realm</li>
                            <li>to say <q>hey not <em>all</em> queer people suffer identity crises <em>all</em> the time (but they still attempt suicide and get murdered)</q>, which is like, um, okay, but i already knew that</li>
                            <li>one of a couple less-noble pursuits (see my other grievances), but i'm gonna give it the benefit of the doubt on this one and say those weren't intentional</li>
                            </ul></li>
                        <li>the film perpetuates the idea that queerness is alien, other, and incompatible with western culture</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Now, there are other things not on this list as well&mdash;the conflation of <i>gay</i> and <i>trans</i>, for example, or the dependency on labels and identity categories&mdash;but, let's face it, that's not what the film was really about and there's a whole mess of culture and linguistics that i'm really not qualified to speak on required in order to discuss that. So, to stick to the points above:</p>

                <section id="stories">
                    <h2>on "queer" stories</h2>
                    <p><u><i>Two Spirits</i></u> is, at its surface, on first glance, the story of one <u>Fred Martinez</u>, his life, and his death. In reality, though, it is none of these things: After watching the film, i couldn't tell you a thing about <u>Fred</u>'s life&mdash;his hobbies, what he was like, who his friends were… there was talk of a telly, but beats me as to what he watched&mdash;and his death was hardly covered at all, except for the sensationalist whodunit grab&mdash;very little background information on the killer, no historical information on the town's racial or cultural contexts… Well, i shouldn't be so harsh. Things <em>were</em> covered, in a sort of well-what-did-you-expect sort of way: Town on the border of a reservation, well <em>of course</em> there is racism and cultural tensions; white dude with criminal history, well <em>of course</em> he would be homophobic and smash someone's head in, why wouldn't he? And while these are perhaps true observations, without critical unpacking they serve only to reinforce the inevitability of this outcome: White men are racist and homophobic, because <em>of course they are</em>.</p>
                    <p>This is a small complaint, this dealing of the death, and on its own i wouldn't have minded. Documentary doesn't want to go into intense detail about the complex social environment of a modern-day town on the edge of a reservation? I don't blame them, especially since that wasn't really the point of the film. I bring it up, though, because it relates to my main point, and probably my least favourite thing about this film:</p>
                    <p>I just watched an hour-long documentary on someone, and i have no fucking clue who he was.</p>
                    <p>It could be argued that this wasn't really a film about <u>Fred Martinez</u> as a person, that it was about the intersectionality of his queerness and his culture, not about his day-to-day life, but being a queer person myself (again, talking generally not identity-categories here) i can tell you that the two are damn near inseprable. Queer people aren't just queer when they're coming out, or being bullied, or attempting suicide, or being murdered. Queer people are queer every fucking day of their lives. And personally i'm pretty fucking tired of queer individuals being acknowledged only insofar as they are victims.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that victimhood can't be a part of a story involving a queer person&mdash;it can, and will if you're being remotely truthful. It is not to pass judgement on whether <u>Fred Martinez</u>'s story should or shouldn't have been told, either&mdash;that's a matter of opinion, at best, and that decision falls to those who actually knew him. But it is to say that if one <em>is</em> going to tell that story, if vey <em>is</em> going to take that leap, then vey had better be damn sure to tell the whole thing, not just the part where the gay guy gets beat up. There's more to the story than that&mdash;obviously, or he wouldn't have gone down that path&mdash;<em>let us see it</em>.</p>
                    <p>In a sense, it is just plain disrespectful. Here we have a person, a brutally murdured person, who had hopes and ambitions and passions and worries, and what is he remembered for? The things he cared about? No, for being queer, being navajo, and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Things entirely out of his control. Circumstances of his existence, not qualities of his being.</p>
                    <p>Again, an argument can be made that we <em>do</em> see a piece of <u>Fred</u> through the film's portrayal; we know that he had his doubts, and that by the end he was very confident in his identity. But, again, we are defining him solely with respect to his nature as a navajo queer individual, and if he weren't navajo and queer we would know nothing about him. The two descriptors i remember from the film were <q>compassionate</q> and <q>beautiful</q>&mdash;highly gendred words, and notable in the fact that they tell us basically nothing about the person they describe.</p>
                    <p>Speaking personally, if the film had looked closely at the weeks, months, years leading up to <u>Fred</u>'s death, if it had shown us his daily life, his faults, his conflicts, his troubles, if it had done that and then only mentioned his death as a footnote, that would have hit me way harder than what i just saw. Because i would have cared. Because i would have gotten to know him. Because his death would have come out of nowhere, as it did, and i would have a deep, personal sense for what was lost. Speaking personally, if it had been me, that's the way i would have wanted it covered.</p>

                <section id="pointless">
                    <h2>this film has no point</h2>
                    <p>And so we are left with a dilemma. Clearly, this film does not aim solely to tell us the story of <u>Fred Martinez</u>, or if it does, it does a pretty poor job of it. But no, it seems like there are other goals in mind.</p>
                    <p>One could argue that the film aims to introduce its viewers to two-spirit culture. This arguement has some validity, as a fair amount of time is spent interviewing other two-spirit&ndash;identified individuals on their experiences; however, two-spirit identification has been documented in over a hundred native-american tribes, of which we see only a few. It could be argued that the film covers two-spirit culture in navajo in particular, but the film offers us little in the way of actual information here, aside from its existance and perhaps the reasons thereof.</p>
                    <p>Rather, it seems that the main goal of the film is not to tell us about <u>Fred Martinez</u> as a person, or to tell us about two-spirit individuals or cultures, but rather to make the statement that <q>hey, cultures that are accepting of queer identifications exist</q>.</p>
                    <p>This is a point without a point. Perhaps for those of us who are sheltered and unaware of the world outside it's surface normativity might find this to be a revelation, but for anyone at all present in modern queer culutres and communities, it is already clear that there are people out there accepting of queer identities. Not enough, oftentimes, and sometimes not where they are needed, but there is no doubt that they exist.</p>
                    <p>I'm tired of queer acceptance being painted as an exciting novelty, something special, something rare. Queer acceptance should be a baseline standard, not a glorious achievment, and instead of celebrating where and when it happens, we need to spend more time calling out where and when it doesn't. </p>

                <section id="propoganda">
                    <h2>this film is propoganda</h2>
                    <p>And not the good kind, either. It tells us the story of a queer person while conveniently glossing over the <i>person</i> bit. It tells us the story of a murder without properly deconstructing the forces and cultures involved. It tells us the story of queer communities while always being sure to mark them as alien, non-western, and incompatible with the dominant cultures in much of <u>the united states</u>. This film exists to give white middle-to-upper-class <u>PBS</u>-watching liberals something to look at, nod, say <q>how interesting</q>, and feel "cultured" without actually having to engage with any actual issues or culture.</p>
                    <p>This is not to dismiss two-spirit cultures, or to say that their stories cannot be told. To the contrary. However, <u><i>Two Spirits</i></u> fails to address the cultures (except to point out their existence) or tell any story (except the predictable non-white&ndash;queer&ndash;is&ndash;victim narrative). Instead, queerness is used as a tool to paint the navajo culture as alien, or the navajo culture is used to paint queerness as alien, depending on your point of reference. Their existences serve only to complement each other in perpetuating the normativity of modern western white culture. <q>Look at these navajo queers</q>, a predictable white-liberal individual might say. <em><q>How interesting.</q></em></p>
                    <p>Although the film does a fair job of illustrating the intersectionality of two-spirit and navajo culture, it fails miserably at illustrating the intersectionality of navajo and white culture, in a town on the border of the reservation, no less. It fails to illustrate the compatibility of queerness with western thought; <q>we usually think of genders as being male or female</q>, one commenter (paraphrased) notes; <q>fuck you</q>, i reply, <q>no i don't</q>. Instead it paints the two as alien, a very clear <u>other</u>, incomprehensible to the western mind, so why even bother explaining?</p>

                <section id="2harsh">
                    <h2>okay, i'm being a bit harsh</h2>
                    <p>I know i am. When it comes to media, once i start focusing on the negatives and heading down that road of deconstruction, it's hard for me to notice anything else. So let me take this space to acknowledge that, despite the problems listed above, the film <em>does</em> do some things right. It brings a culture that would otherwise be ignored and erased to a national audience. It tells people's stories. That's always okay.</p>
                    <p>But i think we can, and should, expect more from our media. I think that we should seek out and tell queer stories in their entirety, not just the parts where people are victimized and bullied. I think that that association is dangerous. I think that when we discuss cultures outside of those of our audience, we should take care not to paint them as alien and isolated, but acknowledge and analyse their interaction with the larger world. I think that instead of focusing on the novelty of queer acceptance, we should be paying more attention to the <i>why</i> and <i>how</i>.</p>
                    <p>I think, moving forward, that those should be included in our goals. Because society.</p>
