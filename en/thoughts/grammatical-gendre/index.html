                    <h2>introduction</h2>
                    <p>The other day, a friend on <a href="http://facebook.com/" target="_blank"><u>the site of evils</u></a> posted a link to <a href="http://allthingslinguistic.com/" target="_blank">a linguistics blog</a> which had a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h-gbeI0AFQ" target="_blank">a video about <i>mele kalikimaka</i></a>, and i looked through the creator's other videos, and saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ehrFk-gLk" target="_blank">this one about <q>gender neutral pronouns</q></a>. I've meddled in <abbr title="Gendre-Neutral Pronouns">GNPs</abbr> before, so i watched, wondering what <a href="https://twitter.com/tomscott" target="_blank">the creator</a> would have to say.</p>

                        <figcaption>Aforementioned video</figcaption></figure>
                    <p>To summarize breifly the main points:</p>
                    <ul><li>Grammatical gendre <q>is just such a stupid concept</q></li>
                        <li>Grammatical gendre affects the way you think</li>
                        <li>Maintaining gendre-neutrality, when this is important, is difficult in languages with grammatical gendre</li>
                        <li>Singular <i>they</i> exists as an alternative to gendred pronouns, and it is here to stay <small>(as a side point, invented pronouns have been completely unsuccessful)</small></li>
                    </ul><p>Now, i'm all for nongendred language, and although i didn't agree with all of the creator's points it was well-produced and got me thinking. So i figured, hey, let's take another look at this beast, and see what we can find.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="development"><h2>the purpose of grammatical gendre</h2>
                    <p>Contrary to the above claim that grammatical gendre is pointless, the fact remains that languages evolve the way they do for a reason. Proponents of nongendred pronoun alternatives can attest to the fact that grammatical structures are not something one can simply come up with and implement overnight; they are the result of systemic shifts in interpretation and understanding. In other words, there was a time (a long long time ago) when grammatical gendre made sense. Whether it still does remains to be seen.</p>
                    <p>Due to the eroticization of the word <i>sex</i> in the twentieth century and <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gender&amp;allowed_in_frame=0" target="_blank">the cultural decision to use <i>gendre</i> as a replacement</a>, we generally think of grammatical gendre in terms of masculine versus feminine, and indeed, this is how some languages treat the concept. However, in many proto&ndash;indo-european languages (including <u>english</u>), there are actually three gendres: <b><i>masculine</i></b>, <b><i>feminine</i></b>, and what is traditionally called <i>neuter</i> but often is better described as <b><i>inanimate</i></b>. One can see this distinction in our third-person singular personal pronouns: <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, and <i>it</i>.</p>
                    <p>It is, perhaps, tempting to think of grammatical gendre as <em>classifying</em>, to think that gendre serves to categorize nouns according to some semantic distinction, like that between male and female, or between animate and inanimate. However, this function is only <em>secondary</em>; it emerges as a convenience but does not explain the true nature of gendre in languages. Note that some languages <em>do</em> have features with this function, either in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_class" target="_blank">noun classes</a> or the aptly-named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_(linguistics)" target="_blank">classifiers</a>.</p>
                    <p>What sets grammatical gendre apart from these sorts of features, though, is the matter of <em>agreement</em>. Strictly defined, grammatical gendre is used to link constituents, either determiners and adjectives to nouns (compare spanish <i lang="es">un libro</i> and <i lang="es">una llave</i>—<i lang="en">un(a)</i> simply means <i>a</i>, which is hardly "gendred" in the traditional sense) or pronouns to antecedents (as in <u>english</u>). In descendents of <u>proto–indo-european</u>, gendre serves not to put words into boxes (categorize), but to mark links between words. This explains is why many languages can assign grammatical gendre to objects with no inherent cultural gendre traits. The femininity of <i lang="es">llave</i>, in <u>spanish</u>, is as a <em>result</em> of the fact that it is modified by feminine-marked adjectives, <strong>not the other way around.</strong></p>
                    <p>At least, that's how it started. However, memorizing the relationships between nouns and the words that modify them can be difficult without some sort of memory aid, and so it followed that meanings were associated with the gendres. Remembering <i lang="en">llave</i> goes with <i>-a</i> can be somewhat tedious, but associating <i lang="en">llave</i> (<i>key</i>) with femininity is relatively easy. Then, if i can just recall that <em>all</em> feminine things (with a few exceptions, perhaps) use <i>-a</i> endings, i'm set. And so grammatical gendre became gendred, so to speak.</p>
                    <p>The point is, grammatical gendre <em>does</em> serve a purpose: It clarifies the link between constituents. To demonstrate, consider the following sentence in <u>spanish</u>: <i lang="es">Saca el libro y la llave; ponlo en la mesa y ponla en la mochila</i> (<i>Get the book and the key; put it on the table and put it in the backpack</i>). In <u>english</u>, it is impossible to know what each <i>it</i> in the sentence refers to, but in <u>spanish</u>, the difference between <i lang="en">ponlo</i> and <i lang="en">ponla</i> clarifies that the first refers to the book, and the second to the key.</p>
                    <p>We see the same sort of thing in <u>english</u>, in places where gendre still exists: Note how <i>He was wealthy. He loved to cook.</i> seems to refer to a single individual, but <i>She was wealthy. He loved to cook.</i> unambiguously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIy3n2b7V9k" target="_blank">refers to two</a>. However, while gendre in <u>spanish</u> is a deeply-entrenched part of the language, gendre in <u>english</u> is more a convenience than anything, and in a grammatical sense hardly exists at all. The difference between <i>he</i> and <i>she</i> is only slightly larger than the difference between <i>miss</i> and <i>mrs.</i>—you will note, an ambiguous third-form for <em>this</em> binary has already been created. Just as it is preposterous to think that <i>miss</i> and <i>mrs.</i> belong to different grammatical gendres, so too is it highly questionable to say that gendre in <u>english</u> has any grammatical basis at all.</p>
                    <p>Instead, the difference is lexical: While it wouldn't be <em>ungrammatical</em> to refer to someone as <i>it</i>, it would be <em>offensive</em>, because it associates with that person an offensive concept (lack of humanity). And while gendre serves as a convenience when dealing with pronouns, that is the <em>only</em> place where it does anything for us—unlike in most languages with gendre, it doesn't clarify the relationships between nouns and adjectives, or morphologically change determiners, or <em>anything</em>. And since the lexical foundations of gendre are now being challenged, it's not surprising that people are looking for an alternative.</p>
                </section><section id="nongendered_pronouns-invented"><h2>invented nongendred pronouns</h2>
                <p>…And that brings us to our main topic. In <u>english</u> the problem of nongendred pronouns is a <em>lexical</em> one, not a grammatical one: This isn't a matter of restructuring our grammars, it's a case of there-isn't-a-word-for-this-thing-i-want-to-express. Fortunately, the english language is very well suited to handle this sort of situation: If there isn't a word for what we want to express, <a href="http://www.americandialect.org/woty/all-of-the-words-of-the-year-1990-to-present" target="_blank">we just make one up</a>.</p>
                <p>And <em>yet</em>. To date, no nongendred pronoun has emerged with wide acceptance. There is certainly need—legal texts and academic papers are chock-full of unweildy <i>he-or-she</i>s; gendre theorists curse the binary that these two words create—and there have <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:List_of_protologisms/third_person_singular_gender_neutral_pronouns" target="_blank">certainly been attempts</a>, but so far none have stuck.</p>
                <p>Part of this comes from outside, people saying that there is no point in creating a new pronoun when we already have a perfectly good set, people saying new pronouns sound alien or un-<u>english</u> (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_derived_from_other_languages" target="_blank">as if <em>that</em> was possible</a>), people sticking to the foolish conventions of yesteryear… but there will always be <a href="http://grammarist.com/usage/moreso/" target="_blank">an opposition to</a> any linguistic change. However, if a single nongendred pronoun could become common subculturally, this usage would easily spread, given the need. Unfortunately, no attempt has as of yet gained wide enough acceptance to be considered even subculturally standard.</p>

                <section id="nongendered_pronouns-they">
                    <h2>singular <i>they</i></h2>
                    <p>Instead, people have been taking a different approach—instead of creating a new nongendred pronoun, why not just expand the defintion of a pronoun we already have? And so, singular <i>they</i> is born.</p>
                    <p><i>They</i>, while usually thought of as a plural pronoun, is actually more than that: It is used in a plural sense, yes, but it is also used when number isn't known or clear. This follows a common pattern in <u>english</u>: The english plural isn't so much a marker of plurality as it is a marker of non-singularity; note how it is used for zero, or decimals (<i>point-eight pizzas</i> is hardly a plurality). Take, for example, the following: <i>I wonder how many people will show up to the party? I hope i have enough appetizers for them.</i> Here, the number of people is unknown (it could be just one), but the plurals <i>people</i> and <i>they</i> are used regardless.</p>
                    <p>Because <i>they</i> is already used with relation to ambiguous number, it isn't a stretch to use it for ambiguous gendre as well. But this comes with a few consequences. The first of these, ambiguity, surfaces in sentences in which a singular-plural distinction is important; much like with <i>you</i>, it can be resolved by appending the word <i>all</i> to the end of the pronoun. If singular <i>they</i> is, as the video above suggests, here to stay, then constructions such as <i>they all</i> (<i>th'all</i>) will soon emerge in the various dialects of <u>english</u>.</p>
                    <p>Another problem arises from the lexical meaning of the word <i>they</i>, and its philisophical implications. While <i>he</i> and <i>she</i> both refer to clearly animate (human-like) individuals, <i>they</i> is used for inanimate objects, and groups of people. In other words, while the personhood of people who use <i>he</i> and <i>she</i> is clearly defined, not so for those who use <i>they</i>. <i>They</i>, by its nature, can have implications of ambiguous personhood or individuality, and this can feed into stereotypes and preconceptions. When i say <i>she was at the park</i>, you know i mean a person, but when i say <i>they were at the park</i>, for all you know i could be talking about a set of swings. In this way, although to a lesser degree, <i>they</i> carries with it the same sorts of problems we find with <i>it</i>.</p>
                    <p>Despite these problems, singular <i>they</i> gets far more use than any invented pronoun, and is well on its way to becoming a core part of english grammar. While it may not be the <em>ideal</em> solution, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they#Older_usage_by_respected_authors" target="_blank">it has a long history</a> and is generally understood by others. In a practical sense, it's the best we've got. <a href="/en/"><svg width="12pt" height="12pt"><use xlink:href="/!DATA!/images/monogram.svg#monogram" /></svg></a></p>
