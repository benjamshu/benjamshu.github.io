            <p>I'm gonna frame this as a q&amp;a even though no-one has asked me any real questions yet.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>So what is this?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Personal web site. Those are still a thing, right?</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Why the hostname <code>benjam.xyz</code>?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>In terms of the <code>xyz</code> <abbr title="Top-Level Domain">TLD</abbr>, cos it's one of the only <abbr title="Top-Level Domain">TLD</abbr>'s that isn't tied to a particular language, and i'm tired of technology always being defined in <u>english</u>.</p>
                    <p>In terms of the <code>benjam</code> part, well, that's kinda my name :P</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Who hosts this?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p><u>Github Pages</u>! I used to have an actual web host and whatnot but then i realized that it's really not something i need. I don't do weird PHP server things; i stick to HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>What is that sick font you're using?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p><i><u>EB Garamond</u></i>, available <a href="http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/">here</a>! It's pretty awesome! I like it, anyway.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>I don't agree with your formatting style.</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>That's not a question. Also, shut up.</p>
