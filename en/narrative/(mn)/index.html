                <h2>back-of-the-book description</h2>
                <p>Having been an orphan for as long as she could remember, <u>mina</u> has not had an easy life. She has worked hard, however, and is now the eldest girl at her orphanage, charged with training the younger girls and helping to maintain order. However, strange circumstances make her leave the life she has built and set out into the unknown…</p>
                <p>She meets up with <u>colum</u>, a local thief, and together the two travel north to the temple <u>ístindur</u>. There, they discover that an ancient evil has awoken, and rush to the capital to inform the guards. They arrive to find the city in festivities: The three spirits have already sensed the evil, and have chosen a hero to vanquish it! After finding their help not needed, the two decide to return home.</p>
                <p>But all is not well! As <u>mina</u> and <u>colum</u> are about to leave the city, an invading force of evil takes hold of the capital. The gates are closed, and all entry and exit is forbidden. Even worse, the fate of the royal princess <u>lilja</u> is unknown! Soon, <u>mina</u> and <u>colum</u> find that the fate of the kingdom&mdash;no, the world&mdash;is in their hands.</p>
