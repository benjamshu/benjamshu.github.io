                <h1>part 1 | <u><i>(mn)</i></u></h1>
                <p><q>Now, <u>arielle</u>, i know it's your first time working like this, but <u>kalle</u> and <u>ella</u> are a very nice couple, and i'll be there with you every step of the way, 'k?</q></p>
                <p><q>'k…</q> <u>Arielle</u> looked, and sounded, rather uncertain.</p>
                <p><u>Mina</u> gave her a playful shove. <q>Oh, come on,</q> she said. <q>It's not like you'll be doing anything you didn't do at the orphanage; just the place has changed, that's all. Isn't it nice to get out of that musty old building, anyways?</q></p>
                <p><q>I guess so,</q> <u>arielle</u> said, shrugging. She looked at her feet as she walked; she didn't look convinced.</p>
                <p><u>Mina sighed</u>. <q>Chin up, <u>ari</u>, it's not like you to be so down.</q></p>
                <p><u>Arielle</u> looked up at her and pouted. <q>But i don't <em>want</em> to clean people's houses!</q></p>
                <p><u>Mina</u> smiled and tousled her hair. <q>Now <em>that's</em> the <u>ari</u> i know. C'mon, it won't be that bad, and if we don't work then how will <u>margaret</u> afford to feed us? Or what about <u>myrra</u>, you gonna make her work instead?</q></p>
                <p><q>No…</q> <u>arielle</u> grumbled.</p>
                <p><q>You're a big sister now,</q> <u>mina</u> said, punching her on the shoulder. <q>That means you get to help take care of the younger ones. Now enough fighting; we're here.</q></p>
                <p>They walked up the steps and knocked on the door. It was opened by an elderly woman, who greeted them with a smile. <q>Hello, girls,</q> she said. <q>There are two of you this time!</q></p>
                <p><u>Mina</u> bowed graciously, nudging <u>arielle</u>, who followed suit. <q>Morning, ma'am,</q> she said. <q>It's <u>arielle</u>'s first time; i'm just here to help out.</q></p>
                <p>The woman nodded her head. <q>Mm, well, i seem to remember you doing a good job,</q> she said, stepping aside to let them in. <q><u>Kalle</u> is inside; come in, i'll show you what needs to be done.</q></p>
                <p>There wasn't much. <u>Kalle</u> and <u>ella</u> were fairly well-off, and had a cook and general housemaid on staff. They only called in extra help to get the place looking nice before hosting a function&mdash;dusting the furniture, polishing the silver, that sort of thing&mdash;and it was really only a one-person job at best. Consequently, the two finished with plenty of time to spare. <q>Better run home, then,</q> <u>ella</u> said, handing <u>arielle</u> their payment. <q>I'm sure we can manage here.</q></p>
                <p>They stepped out onto the street and began the walk back. <u>Arielle</u> looked upwards at <u>mina</u>. <q>I liked <u>ella</u>,</q> she said.</p>
                <p><u>Mina</u> gave her a nudge. <q>Told you,</q> she said. The sun hung low in the sky behind them, and long shadows fell before the duo. It was autumn, and the air was brisk but not yet cold. An elderly fellow in a suit approached them, his cane swinging as he strode. The girls nodded respectfully as he passed.</p>
