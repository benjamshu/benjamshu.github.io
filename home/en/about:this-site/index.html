            <h1>about this site</h1>
            <p>I'm gonna frame this as a q&amp;a even though no-one has asked me any real questions yet_</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>So what is this?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Personal web site_ Those are still a thing, right_?</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Why the hostname <code>faint.xyz</code>?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>In terms of the <code>xyz</code> <abbr title="Top-Level Domain">TLD</abbr>, because it's one of the only <abbr title="Top-Level Domain">TLD</abbr>'s that isn't tied to a particular language, and i'm tired of technology always being defined in english_</p>
                    <p>In terms of the <code>faint</code> part: <q>there was a ghost of a smile on her lips</q>_</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Who hosts this?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Github Pages_! I used to have an actual web host and whatnot but then i realized that it's really not something i need_ I don't do weird PHP server things, i stick to HTML and JavaScript_</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>What is that sick font you're using?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p><i><u>M+ 2m</u></i>, from <a href="http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/">the <i><u>m+ fonts</u></i></a>_! They're pretty awesome_! I like them, anyway_</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>I don't agree with your formatting style</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>That's not a question_ Also, shut up_</p>
