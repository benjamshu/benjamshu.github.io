                    What follows is a theoretical foray into the Internet, its structures, and the implications thereof for the <span class="footnote">queer bodies caught up within its framework.<span class="note">Although some manifestations of gayness certainly <em>are</em> queer, my emphasis in this paper are on those identities which are more difficult to make legible under the data networks of the online world: people who are ace, pan, poly, trans, intersex, genderqueer, et cetera.</span></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because this is academia, and I want to matter, I'm tempted to lead off with some remark about how this sort of thing has never been attempted before, and thus position myself as a pioneer in a new and emerging field.
                    But <a href="http://whitmanpioneer.com/news/2016/02/24/from-the-editors-the-pioneers-name-change/" title="From the Editors: The Pioneer’s Un-naming" target="_blank">pioneers are old-school</a>, and casting myself as the hero doesn't really do anyone else any favours.
                    I certainly <em>hope</em> that I'm not the first one to talk about this stuff, in any case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, it seems important to me to provide in this <a href="#preface"><i>Preface</i></a> <em>some</em> legitimization of my work, if only to give readers a good sense of its strengths and weaknesses from the start.
                    And so, I find myself turning to an essay by <span data-news-metadata-url="http://www.gold.ac.uk/media-communications/staff/ahmed/" data-news-metadata-twitter="SaraNAhmed">Sara Ahmed</span>, ‘Queer Feelings’:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>To be comfortable is to be so at ease with one's environment that it is hard to distinguish where one's body ends and the world begins. One fits, and by fitting, the surfaces of bodies disappear from view. The disappearance of the surface is instructive: in feelings of comfort, bodies extend into spaces, and spaces extend into bodies. The sinking feeling involves a seamless space, or a space where you can't see the 'stitches' between bodies.</p>
                    <footer>Sara Ahmed, ‘Queer Feelings’, in <i>The Cultural Politics of Emotion</i>, second edition (New York: Routledge, 2004), 148.</footer>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    As Ahmed remarks in her essay, comfort often makes the boundaries of a space invisible, and its brushstrokes appear natural.
                    When we are comfortable, the bodies and spaces we inhabit expand, and their forms become difficult to decipher.
                    <em>Dis</em>comfort, on the other hand, brings things into a sharp, often painful, focus, as one's awareness of both body and space are made impossible to ignore.
                    If we are going to speak critically, then, we must speak from a place of discomfort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if my writing this needs justification, let it be this: I have seen the Internet, and it discomforts me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More concretely: The past few years have seen a staggering increase with respect to the regulation, demarcation, and targeted attack of queer and racialized bodies, in a manner as yet unprecedented in spaces online.
                    This is not to say that queer bodies have not been regulated or subject to attack in digital spaces before now&mdash;they have.
                    But as the structures and forms of digital space have solidified, the mechanisms by which normativity is enforced have become themselves normalized and more deeply entrenched within the systems in which they operate, reinforced and made more potent by the concurrent expansion of the possibility for surveillance and of avenues for violence through digital means.
                    We are all of us scared.
                    And while the Internet has radically transformed us, opening up new avenues for connection, support, collaboration, and self-care, creating new modes of agency and expression with respect to identity, community, and desire, so too does it leave much to be sought after in its pursuit of becoming a liveable space.
                    Real structural change is needed, and such change must take root at the level of proliferating conversations and understanding.
                    Consider this my humble contribution to that endeavour.

                    What follows is also my undergraduate thesis in the field of Gender Studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means a couple of things: One, that I researched and wrote it in, like, a month, which means that my potential for being thorough is somewhat diminished; two, that it was written for a grade and in an academic context; three, that I probably don't actually know what I'm talking about.
                    As I will remark further in my <a href="#introduction"><i>Introduction</i></a>, several journalists, organizations, and publications have been on the scene for years, and as a relative newcomer to the conversation, I, myself, have a lot to learn.
                    But while I acknolwedge my own limitations as an author and theorist, I am not about to sit idly by as violence continues to be enacted on the people, organizations, and movements that I care about.
                    We <em>all</em> need to be having this conversation more often.
                    This thesis is but a part.

                    At approximately 02:20 in the morning, on <time datetime="2014-12-28T02:20:00-05:00">28 December 2014</time>, a young trans girl by the name of Leelah Alcorn <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/warren-county/osp-kings-mill-teen-hit-by-semi-and-dies-while-walking-along-sb-i-71" title="OSP: Kings Mill teen hit by semi and dies while walking along SB I-71" target="_blank">walked in front of a semi</a> driving down Interstate 71, killing her on scene.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The circumstances surrounding Leelah's death are only made known to us thanks to a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141229104536/http://lazerprincess.tumblr.com/post/106447705738/suicide-note" title="Suicide Note" target="_blank">suicide note</a> she posted to her Tumblr <span class="footnote">via her queue.<span class="note">The entirety of her Tumblr was later taken down by her parents.</span></span>
                    The post, her story, and the events surrounding it quickly went viral, spawning <a href="http://twitter.com/hashtag/JusticeforLeelah/" title="#JusticeforLeelah" target="_blank">a hashtag</a> (or several), <a href="https://itch.io/jam/jamforleelah" title="#JamForLeelah" target="_blank">a game jam</a>, and petitions on both <a href="https://www.change.org/p/president-of-the-united-states-enact-leelah-s-law-to-ban-transgender-conversion-therapy" title="Enact Leelah's Law to Ban Transgender Conversion Therapy" target="_blank"><i>change.org</i></a> and <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/enact-leelahs-law-ban-all-lgbtq-conversion-therapy" title="Enact Leelah's Law to Ban All LGBTQ+ Conversion Therapy" target="_blank"><i>We the People</i></a>, the latter of which garnered an official response from President Obama.
                    Meanwhile, on internet spaces like Tumblr and Twitter, queer critiques of the circumstances surrounding not only her death, but also her rise to fame (her <span class="footnote">visibility as a white subject;<span class="note">With a platform and followers and who took her own life, in contrast with the disproportionate numbers of trans women of colour who without recognition lose their lives to violence and systemic oppression each year.</span></span> America's <span class="footnote">fascination with death<span class="note">See the tensions between <a href="http://tdor.info/" title="Transgender Day of Rememberance" target="_blank">Transgender Day of Rememberence</a> and <a href="http://www.transstudent.org/tdov" title="Transgender Day of Visibility" target="_blank">Transgender Day of Visibility</a> for an illustration of this debate.</span></span>) as well as the mobilizations that emerged as a result (both in <span class="footnote">methods of activism<span class="note">Is hashtag activism a productive means of mourning?

Although no-one looked to absolve the parents of their blame in the situation, valid questions have been raised about the extent to which they can be blamed for what is a larger systemic and cultural problem and, regardless, whether casting online vitriol towards a couple who had just lost their daughter was really productive. As <span data-news-metadata-url="http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/judith-butler">Judith Butler</span> has noted (<i>Precarious Life</i>), there's something important about being able to mourn.</span></span>) began to emerge, as queer activists found themselves once again forced to resist the perpetual turn towards a white youthful image.
                    As hours turned to days, the news spread, conversations happened, communities mourned, and heartbeats faltered.

                    Over the next twelve months, we stood witness as over twenty trans women in the United States <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unlawfully_killed_transgender_people#2015" title="List of unlawfully killed transgender people § 2015" target="_blank">found their names turned into hashtags</a>, the <span class="footnote">vast majority of them women of colour.<span class="note">This is the highest number of trans murders on record.

                    We watched the murder of Freddie Grey sent Baltimore into a state of emergency through livestreams on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BaltimoreUprising" title="#BaltimoreUprising" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/" title="Periscope" target="_blank">Periscope</a>.
                    We saw the numbers rise in real time as <span data-news-metadata-url="http://www.theguardian.com/us" data-news-metadata-twitter="GuardianUs" data-news-metadata-facebook="GuardianUs"><i>The Guardian</i></span> presented us with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database" title="The Counted: People killed by police in the US" target="_blank">a live counter of police killings</a>, with breakdowns by demographic and state.

                    The internet has changed us.
                    Email, then instant messaging, then social media, have vastly refigured our understanding of connectivity, social networks, and community, as emoji, kitty pidgin, and tweetspeek have revolutionized our approach to the written word.
                    Blogging, hypertext, and wiki technologies have changed the face not only of journalism but information technologies in general, with networks of texts expanding ever outwards in a new and dynamic conversation.
                    Digitial access and distribution has redefined accessibility not only to works of media, but to the tools and pathways for creating and re-producing culture on our own (slashfic and GIF culture, here's looking at you).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, the word <i>accountability</i> found itself imbued with new meaning, as everybody from the largest corporation to the smallest journalist has found themselves suddenly approachable by any and every member of their audience.
                    Organized hashtag campaigns have been leveraged both as mechanisms for speaking out against injustice and as tools for brute-force harrassment, sometimes simultaneously, as one group of individuals co-opts the project of another.
                    Online petitioning systems have made it easier than ever to show solidarity, while critiques of slacktivism and liberal showmanship have called into question what <q>solidarity</q> even means.
                    And all the while, millions of people find themselves managing their work relationships, checking with friends, purchasing music, streaming videos, and tweeting to nobody and everybody about their lives, the massive cultural and political shifts happening around them little more than a subtle undercurrent in their day-to-day lives.

                    Of course, for those who have been living through these changes, none of this is news.
                    People have been writing about their experiences online for as long as the medium has provided them with an opportunity to do so, and in recent times the extent of this journalism has only increased.

                    This paper is greatly indebted to the work of these individuals, and I'll be speaking more directly in conversation with many of them in the chapters to come.
                    In short, the question I pose is this: How are digital spaces constructed, and what are the implications of this on mechanisms of power and identity online?
                    More importantly, how can we negotiate these factors to broaden the scope of livable lives past that of patriarchal, white-supremacist normativity?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this <a href="#introduction"><i>Introduction</i></a>, I have done my best to frame the conversation that follows.
                    <a href="#space"><i>Chapter Two</i></a> will continue my line of inquiry into the idea of the internet as space&mdash;or rather, space<em>s</em>.
                    How do internet systems and structures come to be experienced as spaces, and how are these spaces formed, both in relation to each other, and to the bodies which inhabit them?
                    For that matter, how are bodies formed online, and how do bodies take up space?
                    How are boundaries created and inforced in digital spaces, both implicitly and explicitly, and what comes to denote a queer space?
                    A safe space?
                    A <em>livable</em> space?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <a href="mediation"><i>Chapter Three</i></a>, our understanding of space becomes more complicated, as we examine the ways in which internet spaces are by nature <em>mediated</em>.
                    How do the affordances provided by digital spaces come to structure the cultures which develop inside them, and how does culture at-large shape the affordances which are deemed important to provide?
                    How have specific digital spaces dealt with mediation in the past, and what can this teach us about their nature?

                    Finally, <a href="identity"><i>Chapter Four</i></a> ties these themes back into concepts of identity, visibility, and individual action.
                    How are identities constructed online, and to what extent are these constructions forced onto their keepers?
                    How are identities made visible and/or invisible by spaces and mediated structures, and how does anonymity intersect with indentity performance?
                    How are identities created through data, and how do they exceed the data which defines them?

                    The scope of these questions are enormous, and this paper can provide no definitive answers.
                    But at their heart is a deeper, more essential focus:
                    What can we do to make sure we can pass through these spaces and come out alright?
                    Not <em>good</em>, not even <em>safe</em>&mdash;not yet.
                    But alright.
                    It is not a question with an easy answer, and the conversation is ongoing.
