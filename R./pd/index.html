                <h2>01 Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    <q>It's called the nBox, and it's, like, totally the next big thing. The UX alone is just… so sleek.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    She looked at me emphatically for a second before returning her eyes to her phone.
                    She was in her travel getup&mdash;a faded Hawkman t-shirt, because we were flying, and a tattered pair of Levi's, because pockets.
                    Today, she wore a jean jacket to match, in case the weather was a little cooler at our destination.
                    For now, we were sitting in an airport Starbucks, enjoying a morning coffee before our flight.
                    Alice got a medium chai.
                    I had a mocha.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feigned interest, not that it took much to keep Alce going when she got like this.
                    Her thumb scrolled quickly across the surface of her phone as she took a sip.
                    <q>nBox,</q> I said, trying out the word.
                    <q>Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I could feel Alice rolling her eyes at me; I refreshed my Twitter feed, avoiding her gaze.
                    <q>That's not the <em>point</em>, dummy,</q> she said, playfully exasperatied.
                    <q>I mean, <em>look</em> at it. Look at this.</q>
                    I glanced over as she angled her screen towards me.
                    A nondescript black box stared back through the pixels.
                    I didn't see the big deal.
                    <q>That <em>there</em> is the future&mdash;I'm talking a revolution of entire <em>industries</em>: engineering, media, education, you name it. It's, like, the greatest invention since…</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>The Internet?</q>
                    No unread messages.
                    I took a bite of my breakfast sandwich.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Lol. Okay, maybe not <em>that</em> big. But smartphones, maybe.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Mmhmm.</q>
                    There were plenty of people passing us by, but in the café, we were alone.
                    I figured most folks were sensibly waiting at their gates; I was only there at Alice's behest&mdash;something about free Wi-Fi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alice's tone turned indignant.
                    Apparently I wasn't doing as good of a job feigning interest as I had thought.
                    <q>Oh, I'm sorry,</q> she said.
                    <q>Have I been boring you with <em>the future of life as we know it?</em></q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Sorry,</q> I replied.
                    <q>Tech's just not really my thing.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    She winked at me.
                    <q>You don't <em>have</em> a thing, dude.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alice.
                    This was Starbucks.
                    <q>Maybe I don't <em>need</em> a thing,</q> I retornted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Suuurree.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I punched her on the arm, maybe a little harder than I had intended.
                    <q>Hey,</q> I said.
                    <q>Not funny.</q>
                    But it was Alice.
                    I was smiling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She rolled her eyes at me and stuck out her tongue.
                    Her watch lit up with a buzz, and she swiped its face with her finger.
                    <q>Flirting time's over,</q> she said, a twinkle in her eye.
                    <q>Time to fly.</q>
                </p>

                <h2>02 Flight</h2>
                <p>
                    Alicia May Thomas was born at 7:35 in the morning on the 18th of November, as the first and only ochild of Amanda Winter and Ramon Thomas, who at that time had been married for a little over a year.
                    As a child, she had been highly adventurous, making friends with the kids in her neighbourhood and every creature within a mile's radius of her house; in school, this translated into a natural curiosity that enabled her to easily outperform her peers, much to the surprise of her instructors.
                    Her mother enrolled her in piano lessons at the age of four, and she studiously applied herself to classical masterpieces for years before discovering punk music at the age of sixteen.
                    Her extra-curriculars included student government (senior class president), marching band (drum major for two years), mathematics team (at her mother's request), robotics club (her choice), and the school paper (as the senior editor).
                    As valedictorian, she gave the best speech at our graduation, and she readily procured a merit-based full-ride to virtually any college of her choosing, with test scores that were off the charts.
                    It begged the question, then, what she was doing taking a seat next to <em>me</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She hoisted her carry-on into the overhead compartment and flopped down beside me with a sigh.
                    <q>Ugh,</q> she said, turning off her phone.
                    <q>Shouldn't've packed so much stuff.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I laughed.
                    <q>Not like we're travelling hundreds of miles to live on our own for the first time in our lives, or anything.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    She punched my arm lightly.
                    <q>Touché,</q> she said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our destination was Mebaun University, a smallish, relatively-unheard-of affair, not Ivy League or anything, as evidenced by the fact that they let <em>my</em> sorry ass in.
                    What Alice saw in them was beyond me, and I worried that she was settling so that we wouldn't end up separated.
                    Their computer-science division couldn't be <em>that</em> <q>out of this world.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The flight attendants gave their usual opening babble, and I pretended to pay attention.
                    Her hands finally free, Alice nudged me excitedly.
                    <q>You ready for this?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Yeah,</q> I said as the attendants finished their spiel, ignoring the pain in my chest which told me otherwise.
                    The airplane shifted under us as it got into runway position.
                    <q>You?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alice laughed in her characteristic manner.
                    <q>Dude. I was <em>born</em> ready,</q> she replied.
                    <q>I was talking to Miguel, and he was all <q>idk how i feel abt u chicago man, what if i dont make any friends,</q> and I was like, <q>are u kiddin me rn u gon be the most popular dude there,</q> and, like, IDK. I feel like there's this <em>thing</em>…</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plane started accelerating, and we were off the ground.
                    Distracted, I closed the book that had been lying open in my lap, watching the ground fall away beneath us.
                    The ivory clouds were soft and expansive as we rose into their midst, leaving the greyness of the city behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>…and like packing my stuff for me, and it was like, <q><em>Mom.</em> I get that you wanna feel useful, but I got it. <em>I'm in college now</em>…</q></q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In college now.
                    The phrase had a heavy weight to it, and I felt like it had yet to fully sink in.
                    I looked around the cabin to keep my thoughts in warmer waters&mdash;it was pretty quiet, mostly suits with their faces in ledgers and screens and books.
                    At the front, attendants were already beginning to pass out refreshments.
                    Headphones abounded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For her part, Alice was already pulling back out her phone.
                    <q>I don't even know, man,</q> she said.
                    <q>How 'bout you?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hadn't been paying attention, obviously.
                    <q>What do you mean?</q> I asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Family giving you shit or anything?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Oh. Nah.</q>
                    It was true.
                    I had half-expected my mother to fly up with me, but work obligations got in the way, apparently, and as sweet as she was there was no way my sister was making the trip on her own.
                    They were pretty casual about seeing me leave, though&mdash;I think they were just happy that I got into somewhere relatively okay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Lucky.</q>
                    Alice pulled her phone back out of her pocket and started to power it back on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The refreshments finally reached our aisle, cutting our conversation short.
                    I got a Coke&mdash;sweet, caffeinated beverages always helped me to deal with stress.
                    The ice melted into my cup in that way that only airline ice can, and I held the flavour in my mouth for a moment before swallowing.
                    My mouth felt dry, and I took another sip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried to make progress in my book, but of course I couldn't concentrate, so I closed it and leand up against Alice's shoulder.
                    She was messaging someone, now, and I could feel the screentaps resonating through her upper arm.
                    I glanced over her body: She was taller than I was, and more fit, dammit&mdash;I closed my eyes.
                    Stress never helped with these sorts of things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I took a deep breath, and drifted off to sleep.
                </p>

            <section id="03">
                <h2>03 Arrival</h2>
                <p>
                    <q>Hey girls, you here to check in?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The question was directed at us.
                    Alice rolled her eyes knowingly at me, then gave the woman a nod.
                    <q>Yep. That's us. Girls, ready to check in. Alicia Thomas, reporting for duty.</q>
                    She gave a small salute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The woman checked her list.
                    <q>Alicia? You're in Room 127, down the hall to your left.</q>
                    She handed Alice a folder stuffed with papers.
                    <q>Your key is in the envelope. And you?</q>
                    The woman's gaze turned to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Naomi Tyler, ma'am.</q>
                    My curtsy was mostly ironic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Room 134. Same instructions. I'm Tami, and I'm this building's director. You have a problem, you come to me or one of the resident assistants. Hall meeting is tomorrow at 7pm; bring your green forms, signed. Read through the brocure, it has an agenda for opening week.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found Alice tugging me away.
                    <q>Got it; will do, ma'am; thanks.</q>
                    She was bailing me out.
                    Her pace slowed once we got out of earshot, and she dropped beside me.
                    She gave me a gentle nudge in the side with her elbow, proxy for a hug.
                    <q>You still got this?</q> she asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to resent her for thinking I had been affected, but of course she was right.
                    Still, this wasn't my first rodeo.
                    I put on a tough face.
                    <q>I'm fine,</q> I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>The curtsy was a nice touch,</q> she said, jibing a little.
                    <q>I didn't think you had it in you.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I gave her a shove.
                    <q>Shut <em>up</em>,</q> I said.
                    Did she come along just to watch me suffer?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Lol, you mad bro?</q>
                    She raised her eyebrows at me in jest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Oh, don't you sound so satisfied about it,</q> I told her, rolling my eyes.
                    <q>I know when I'm being trolled.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were at her door, and she let her bags fall to the ground as she fumbled for her key.
                    <q>It's for your own good, silly,</q> she replied, turning the handle.
                    <q>See? Tension defused.</q>
                    The door swung open easily on its hinges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>For now,</q> I said, taking a peek inside her room.
                    It was empty&mdash;her roommate hadn't yet arrived.
                    <q>Know when your partner-in-crime gets in?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Tomorrow,</q> Alice replied, waving her phone at me.
                    <q>We've been in touch.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Mmm,</q> I said.
                    I rolled slowly back on my heels as the moment lingered.
                    <q>I should probably, um…</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Yeah, of course! Get moved in.</q>
                    Alice was busy digging through her bags; I had lost her attention.
                    I turned to leave.
                    <q>Hey, dude,</q> she said, stopping me in the doorway.
                    I glanced back and she was looking up at me.
                    <q>Meet back here in thirty? Moving in fully can wait; I wanna check out campus.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Sure thing,</q> I said.
                    She knew me too well.
                    <q>See you soon.</q>

                <h2>04 Meeting</h2>
                <p>
                    <q>I hate it when they just talk at you like you're completely green, though, y'know?</q>
                    We had gone out for dinner, and were on our way back.
                    Alice, as usual, was the one talking.
                    <q>It's like, dude, I was speaking Perl in the fifth grade. Javascript is my motherfucking <em>native language</em>. And <em>you're</em> gonna try and learn <em>me</em> some prototype chain? Nuh-uh.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Truly a despicable gesture,</q> I told her.
                    I had no idea what she was talking about.
                    <q>Poor boys don't understand who they're talking to.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>I know, right?!</q>
                    She slammed her hand against the crosswalk signal.
                    <q>Boys are such fucking losers sometimes. No offense.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wasn't offended.
                    The signal toggled to walk, and we stepped out into the street.
                    <q>You think that'll happen here?</q> I asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her fingers ran through her hair.
                    <q>God, I hope not. It's one of the reasons I picked this place.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>How so?</q>
                    She hadn't mentioned this to me before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Diversity, y'know? You go to too pretentious a place, and it's like <em>bam</em>. Cookie-cutter level maximum. Only a certain kind of people going there, after all. And if you don't fit that mold, well…</q>
                    She shrugged.
                    <q>I don't know. It feels weird talking about it. It's not something I usually worry about.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I put my arm around her waist as we walked.
                    <i>Diffuse the tension.</i>
                    <q>And here I thought you were only coming here for me,</q> I told her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She gave me a look.
                    It evolved into an eye-roll.
                    <q>I can have multiple reasons,</q> she said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As if sensing the ebb in the conversation, her watch let off a soft chime.
                    She glanced at the face, then stopped in her tracks.
                    <q>Oh shit,</q> she said.
                    <q>I'm, uh, gonna have to bail. You think you can make it back on your own?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Um, yeah, of course.</q>
                    With food in my stomach, I actually felt pretty good.
                    <q>What's up?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Oh, I just have a meeting&mdash;sorry, man, I totally spaced it. Blah blah Mebaun University students diverse backgrounds free dessert&mdash;y'know.</q>
                    She gestured with one hand into the air.
                    <q>One of those things. I'll grab you a cookie, okay?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Okay.</q>
                    I started walking again.
                    <q>See you when you get done, I guess.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Yeah. I'll shoot you a message.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I continued back to the dorm in silence.
                    The sun hung low in the sky, and the air was cool but temperate.
                    A light breeze blew through the thin fabric of my blouse, and for once I didn't midn that I was wearing it.
                    It looked nice, and was comfortable; a practical choice if nothing else for the first day in a new city.
                    I took off my cap and combed my hair with my fingers.
                    Maybe now that I was away from home I could finally cut it short.
                    I suppressed a yawn as I entered the building.
                    It had been a long day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to be around for when Alice got done with her meeting, and I wasn't in the mood for unpacking, so I passed up the hallway to my room and headed instead for the floor's common area.
                    It was empty, save for one girl sitting at the table, nose in a book.
                    She wore a leather jacket and gloves, black jeans, a loud t-shirt for a band I'd never heard of.
                    Her hair was chopped short and dyed black; her lips were pursed as her eyes traced the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wondered if I should leave.
                    A large part of me didn't want to.
                    I glanced at my watch, staring at the face but not bothering to read the time.
                    <i>Fuck it,</i> I thought. <i>It's my first day.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    She looked friendly. I took a seat to her right.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="05">
                <h2>05 Conversation</h2>
                <p>
                    The girl didn't notice my presence at first.
                    I immediately questioned the wisdom of my decision, although it was now too late to turn back&mdash;I wasn't about to get up and leave after having just sat myself down.
                    I tried words instead: <q>Um. Hi?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    She looked up and finally acknowledged my existence.
                    <q>Oh,</q> she said.
                    <q>Hi.</q>
                    The room froze for a moment in silence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>I'm… Naomi.</q>
                    I hoped that a name might help to smooth over the awkwardness.
                    <q>Sorry, I just got here, and saw you sitting there, and I don't really know many people at this school, and…</q>
                    Yes, I was rambling.
                    It was a great sign.
                    <q>…and, IDK, I thought maybe we could get to know each other.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was more words than I had said in one breath for probably over a year, but to my surprise the girl seemed to soften a little upon hearing them.
                    Her book closed slowly between her hands.
                    <q>I'm Rachel,</q> she said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i><em>Rachel</em>.</i>
                    Somehow, those two words seemed more profound than all of mine put together.
                    I was at a loss for words.
                    <q>I, uh… I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    She shrugged her shoulders.
                    <q>'S okay. 'Mn't either.</q>
                    She set the book gently on the table.
                    <q>I was sorta generally avoided in high school.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Oh.</q>
                    There was a story there, I could tell, but I wasn't sure if she was ready to tell it.
                    <q>I'm sorry.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Eh.</q>
                    Rachel adjusted her jacket.
                    <q>It was my own fault. What about you? Any friends back home?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I smiled at the question.
                    Alice.
                    <q>One. Well, sorta. She goes here now, too.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rachel raised an eyebrow.
                    <q>Oh?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I rolled my eyes, getting the gist of where she was headed.
                    <q>No, not like that. I mean… it didn't work out. We're friends.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    She leaned back in her chair.
                    <q>Yeah, I had a boyfriend once.</q>
                    Her head nodded gently, and she seemed lost in thought.
                    <q>He died.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, <em>fuck</em>.
                    How was I supposed to respond to that?
                    <q>…I'm sorry,</q> I said.
                    I tried to sound sincere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>It was a car accident,</q> she told me.
                    <q>Bad weather; nobody's fault. Could've happened to anyone. But yeah, fucked me up pretty bad afterwards.</q>
                    She opened the cover of her book and looked at the inside flap, although I got the sense she wasn't really reading it.
                    The air felt heavy, and a little sacred.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>I'm trans,</q> I said.
                    It was… not what I expected my next two words to be, but it was the only statement I had which seemed to match the gravity of the situation.
                    I felt my heart skip a beat, and my breath caught.
                    <q>I mean… I don't think of myself as a girl.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    She glanced up at me.
                    <q>You don't look like a girl,</q> she said, almost matter-of-factly.
                    I didn't know what to make of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Sorry, I'm just… I'm not really <em>out</em> yet though, so if you could…</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Yeah. Of course.</q>
                    She adjusted the fit on her gloves.
                    I felt my pocket buzz; it was Alice.
                    <i class="txt">ditchin early,</i> her message read.
                    <i class="txt">u in yr room?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I glanced up at Rachel, then began typing my reply.
                    <q>Sorry,</q> I said to her.
                    <q>Just letting my friend know where I'm at.</q>
                    <i class="txt">main commons. i maybes just, um, told someone im actually a guy.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>'S fine,</q> she told me.
                    <i class="txt">BREH. WHATT.</i>
                    <q>She gonna stop by?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Not sure.</q>
                    <i class="txt">shhh im tryn not to think abt it.</i>
                    I put away my phone.
                    <q>You have any plans for tomorrow?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Nope.</q>
                    Rachel covered her mouth as she yawned.
                    <q>Doesn't look like there's a whole lot going on until evening. You?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>IDK,</q> I said.
                    I glanced at my watch, reading it this time.
                    It felt way later than it actually was.
                    <q>We'll see if I get up in time for church.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Man, I haven't been to church since like kindergarten.</q>
                    She scratched her head with her right hand, then let it rest on her leg.
                    I could feel my heart rate slowing&mdash;Rachel was an easy person to talk to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the distance, I heard a door open, and I leaned back to see Alice walking my way.
                    She tossed me something, wrapped in a napkin.
                    <q>Hey, man,</q> she said.
                    <q>Chocolate chip okay?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cookie.
                    Right.
                    <q>You know it is.</q>
                    I took a bite and chewed it lightly.
                    Then I remembered myself.
                    <q>Oh yeah, introductions. Alice: Rachel. Rachel: the friend I was talking about.</q>
                    A chocolate chip fell out of my mouth as I spoke and I struggled to catch it on its way to the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alice nodded her head.
                    <q>Hey,</q> she said, checking out my new friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rachel raised her eyebrows.
                    <q>A pleasure.</q>

                    They had been talking for several minutes.
                    Now that Alice was here, I was happy to stay in the audience.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Yeah, I know where it is,</q> Alice told her.
                    <q>I've got cousins there.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rachel seemed a little uncomfortable about this last piece of information.
                    <q>Anyone I would know?</q> she asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>I doubt it,</q> Alice said.
                    <q>The eldest is only eight.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alice's mom was an only child, which meant that her cousins all bore some relation to her father.
                    I knew she had a fondness for that side of her family, but she almost never had the opportunity to spend time with them&mdash;logistically speaking, it rarely worked out.
                    I wondered if she had ever met the cousins of which she spoke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Have you looked through the opening packet yet?</q> There had been a copy on the table, and Rachel was now thumbing through it.
                    I felt like I must have missed something while lost in thought&mdash;the change in topic seemed rather abrupt.
                    <q>Looks like they've got a fair amount lined up for us next week,</q> she continued.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Eh, none of it looked interesting,</q> Alice replied.
                    <q>Seemed like kinda a bore.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>You didn't find anything there that snagged your interest?</q>
                    Rachel looked up from the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Lol, I'm not looking forward to hearing old white dudes drone on about the dangers of drugs and sex, no.</q>
                    Alice was messaging someone, now.
                    I wondered if it was her roommate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rachel opened her mouth, but then closed it.
                    I don't think she was expecting to run up against such a brick wall; I could tell she was searching for something to say.
                    <q>Okay…</q> she began, finally.
                    <q>So, um, how did you and Naomi meet?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alice rolled her eyes.
                    <q>We went to high school together. It just sorta happens, y'know?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Naomi made it sound like maybe you were&mdash;</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Dude took me to prom.</q>
                    Alice cut the question short.
                    Her fingers had stopped typing, and I watched her screen go black from lack of activity.
                    <q>Things happened. Now we're here. What's it to you?</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Nothing, sorry.</q>
                    I had to admit, Alice was being unusually harsh&mdash;I wondered if something had happened at her meeting.
                    Rachel seemed a little hurt.
                    <q>Just trying to make conversation.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stepped in to try to calm things down.
                    <q>Um, look,</q> I said.
                    <q>It's been kinda a long day; Alice and I should probably head to bead…</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>I'm fine,</q> she shot back.
                    Jesus fuck, Alice, work with me here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I let out a loud sigh.
                    <q>Well, <em>I'm</em> heading to bed then.</q>
                    I wasn't about to stick around and watch them argue, in any case.
                    I turned down the hall and unlocked the door to my room, throwing myself down on the bed without bothering to turn on the lights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It didn't take long for my phone to start buzzing.
                    <i class="txt">dont need u to keep me in ✓, DAD.</i>
                    I rolled my eyes.
                    Grow up, Alice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tossed the phone on my bed and pulled off my blouse, looking through my bags for my pajamas.
                    I unhooked my bra and pulled the flannel shirt over my head as my pants hit the floor.
                    My phone buzzed again as I tousled my hair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i class="txt">Sry bro. kno ur right. going to beds.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I smiled.
                    Alice rarely stayed mad for long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She followed it with another.
                    <i class="txt">R. sayz if u go curch 2morrow, she wouldn't mind joinin.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My pulse jumped, and in the darkness, the screen burned the letters into my eyes. My fingers fumbled over the letters as I typed out my reply: <i class="txt">GET ME HER NUMBER.</i>
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 0; padding-left: 4em;">
                    <i class="txt">i mean room # of course<br>tell her i'll be sure to stop by</i>
