                    The story of the American social justice movements is the story of the transition between the naturalization of class elitism, white supremacy, patriarchy, <span class="footnote">and heteronormativity<span class="note">And soon, cisnormativity.</span></span> and their formulation as extinct.
                    Born in a time after the supposed advancements of the New Deal, the Civil Rights Movement, First- and Second-Wave Feminism, and now Marriage Equality, Millennials and Post-Millennials have been raised to operate under the assumption that equality has been achieved and the age of social justice is over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this starting point, there are two possible ways for one's worldview to evolve.
                    For some, generally well-off cis white men, often in <abbr title="Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics">STEM</abbr>-like sectors which emphasize measurable, objective truth, the best course of action is to double-down on this fantasy, dismissing, debating, or attacking any evidence to the contrary.
                    Because the dominant Millennial narrative views obstacles to social justice as localized evils which must be combatted and contained, any recognition of these problems in one's own actions becomes a threat that must be guarded against.
                    By necessity, society is conceived as a meritocratic utopia, in which those with the skills to succeed always will&mdash;for those in positions of success, this becomes a source of validation, and for those willing to recognize imbalances on the axes of race and gender, this can lead to the conclusion that white men consistently find themselves in positions of privilege for the sole reason that they are actually literally better than everyone else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A great deal has been written on the nature and implications of this mentality (see <a href="#appx-a">Appendix A</a>), so I'm not going to go into it here.
                    Instead, I want to focus on everyone else; that is, those people who have been sold an image of reality that is free and equal, but then later realized, for whatever reason, that <em>that is not this world</em>.
                    I'm going to call this outlook <dfn>Post-Millennial</dfn>, in that it is a radical troubling of the <dfn>Millennial</dfn> outlook which preceeds it, and I would argue that the distinction between these two ways of looking at the world has supplanted traditional formulations like <i>conservative</i> and <i>liberal</i> to form the foundation for the modern American political axis.
                    In a generation raised on the belief that all people are created equal, that the institutions of capitalism and meritocracy are fair and balanced, that the American state is exceptional and justified, and that conditions of inequality exist firmly in the past, the divide between <i>Millennial</i> and <i>Post-</i> lies precisely between those committed to the fantasy, and those vehemently critical of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would feel weird, after such a grand setup, to say <q>now what has this done to <em>gender</em>??!</q> if the answer wasn't <q>omigosh so much.</q>
                    And so what follows is a brief (under 4000 words, in any case) analysis of what this shift might mean, how it can trouble and open up new possibilities for our conceptions of gender and of a gendered life.
                    My examples are drawn from recent works of art and criticism, which I feel hold the potential for Post-Millennial modes of interpretation and embody the characteristics blah blah blah.

                    Before looking at the ways our understanding of gender is being conceptualized and reworked by Millennial and Post-Millennial sensibilities, we first need to develop our understanding of what gender <em>is</em>.
                    I will do so by building upon and critiquing existing work in feminist and queer theoretical fields, moving away from a simple binary- or spectrum-based model to one built on relationality and assemblage, before demonstrating how, when viewed through a dyadicocispatriarchial lens, this consolidates itself into the formal conceptualizations of masculinity and femininity we recognize today.
                    <!--  perhaps revise this last sentence to talk more about gender states and leave dyadicocispatriarchy for next section  -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned in <a href="http://benjam.xyz/writings/gaga/" target="_blank">my response to <i>Gaga Feminism</i></a>, I'm not interested in a model of gender which depends upon biology, sexuality, or reproduction; the presence of trans ace individuals demonstrates that gender must operate even when removed from these contexts.
                    However, the fact cannot be overlooked that these factors <em>do play a role</em> in how gender functions&mdash;for some individuals if not for all.
                    In <i>Queer and Now</i>, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick <span class="footnote">provides a mechanism<span class="note">Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, <i>Queer and Now</i>, in <i>The Routledge Queer Studies Reader</i>, edited by Donald E. Hall and Annamarie Jagose with Andrea Bebell and Susan Potter (New York: Routledge, <time datetime="2013">2013</time>), 7‚Äì9.</span></span> for handling this disconnect: by viewing gender (in her words, <i>sexual identity</i>) as not a simple masculine/feminine binary, but rather as the confluence of a wide variety of factors, some of which resonate with one another, others of which might not.
                    To Sedgwick, this is the (or, at least, <em>a</em>) very definition of queerness: <q>the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone's gender, of anyone's sexuality aren't made (or <em>can't be</em> made) to signify monolithically.</q>

                    As <a href="#fig-1">Figure 1</a> shows, however, approaching gender from the perspective of a list of attributes, the values of which may or may not align according to normative standards, risks reducing it into a simple protocol to which gendered individuals might be said to conform.
                    Such an approach is of only limited use, as it neglects to describe in any meaningful way the modes by which these attributes inform and are informed by each other; furthermore, <span class="footnote">its object-oriented emphasis<span class="note">For more on the dangers of an object-oriented approach, see <a href="http://benjam.xyz/Ana/proposal/" target="_blank">my thesis proposal</a> and <a href="http://benjam.xyz/writings/puar2/" target="_blank">my response to Jasbir Puar</a>.</span></span> makes the assumption that these attributes have meaning <em>in isolation</em>, that one can be said to have a sex, or a gender, without reference to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we can make a more nuanced application of Sedgwick's formulation, conceiving of gender not as a protocol but rather as a general modality determined by a variety of attributes, the number, quality, and values of which are formed not statically but instead through relation to others.
                    As I will discuss in <a href="#03">¬ß03</a>, the existence of gender is necessitated by our position within a patriarchial structure.
                    However, the forms that this gender can take, the ways it is displayed and interpreted, its number and fluidity, its legibilty and acceptability, and its overall impact on a person's life can vary widely.
                    As such, it would be foolish to think of gender as a binary, as a set of two elements (even considering the possibility of embodying both or neither).
                    In many cases, the only apparent tie between models of masculinity and femininity are their levels of acceptability for male-bodied and female-bodied individuals, respectively; as we have already noted, however, privileging sex as <em>the</em> defining factor in gender formulation ignores the incredible amount of diversity that gendered forms can take.

                    In <i>The Legend of Korra</i>, an animated television series by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino, we can look to the primary cast for an example of how gender diversity can take shape.
                    Korra, the series' protagonist, is  headstrong, rugged, independent, emotional, impatient; she cares about living up to others' expectations for her and performing her duty to the world.
                    She pays little attention to her appearance, never wears makeup, and in the fourth season, cuts her hair short.
                    Asami<span class="spoiler">, her eventual girlfriend,</span> is flexible, composed, reliant, thoughtful, calculating; she cares about salvaging her family's legacy and being a source of support for those around her.
                    She is always seen in lipstick and eyeshadow, her clothes are usually the height of fashion, and her hair is long and flowing.
                    However, despite the immediate differences in gender presentation, <em>both characters are depicted as equally valid representations of femininity</em>, and never in the show is either suggested to be either less competent or less womanly because of it.

                    Building off of <span class="footnote"><i>Avatar</i><span class="note"><i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> is the prequel series to <i>Korra</i></span></span> and <i>Korra</i>'s conception of Nations, we can imagine gender as states, whose conditions and location can prefigure the presentations and outlooks of their inhabitants, but to which citizenship and alliegance is neither promised nor assured.
                    Such a hypothetical gender-state takes its shape only through contact with its neighbours, and we can imagine a history of growth and decay, conquest and defeat, colonization, revolution, and independence, through which our current landscape has formed.

                    Gender relations, of course, actually take place within an n-dimensional hyperspace of which any sort of positive topology or mapping is impossible, but for the sake of convenience let's stick with a two-dimensional model.
                    As <a href="#fig-4">Figure 4</a> demonstrates, attempting to project this geography onto a linear spectrum not only leaves the vast majority of the map unexplored, but also fails to take into account the differing polarizations of the states which lie upon its axis.
                    What does a phrase like <i>more masculine</i> mean when some modes of masculinity find themselves closer in proximity to feminine states than other masculine ones?

                <p>
                    It is important to note that the model of gender which I have proposed is not of an inherently problematic nature&mdash;in a world in which citizenship within and movement between gender-states is not regulated by power structures, in which the boundaries and conditions of states are in constant flux and open to change, in which new ones may crop up at any time and old ones may fade away, and in which legibility and grievability is made available to all, gender poses no unique threat to identity or personhood.
                    This is, of course, not the world in which we live.
                    But I do want to stress the fact that gender itself does <em>not</em> need to be undone; rather, the conditions which structure and mediate its boundaries need to be evaluated and brought into question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most well-known and theorized of these structures is that of the <dfn id="patriarchy">patriarchy</dfn>, which predicates itself on the assumption (01) that genders are categorizable into at least two distinct groups, and (02) that one of these groups (<dfn id="masculinity">masculinity</dfn>) is more desirable than the others.
                    Patriarchy itself does not foreclose the opportunity for <em>more than two</em> gender categories; as we have seen with white supremacy, it is possible to have a wide variety of categorizations without threatening the sovereignty of the dominant form.
                    The gender binary as we understand it today depends instead upon <span class="footnote"><dfn id="dyadiconormativity">dyadiconormativity</dfn>,<span class="note">&lt; <i>dyadic</i> ("male/female") + <i>normativity</i></span></span> the assumption that sex is an unambiguous biological determination of exactly one of {<i>male</i>, <i>female</i>}, and <dfn id="cisnormativity">cisnormativity</dfn>, the assumption that sex and gender must correlate in a meaningful and societally predetermined way.
                    When taken together, dyadicocisnormatity imposes onto individuals societal categories of masculinity and femininity based on a premise of assumed biological cohesion.
                    This combines with patriarchial normativity to function as a privileging of certain individuals over others, predecated on conformance to structural norms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because dyadicocisnormativity posits that (01) every individual has a sex, male xor female, and (02) that sex and gender are linked, every individual operating under a dyadicocisnormative structure finds themselves interpellated necessarily as either masculine or feminine.
                    This is reflected in the English third-person pronouns, <i>he</i> and <i>she</i>, and the fact that our nongendered pronoun, <i>they</i>, is also the one we use for <i>underpants</i>.
                    Dyadicocisnormativity tolerates androgyny only insofar as it is, at best, ambiguously human, or at least ambiguously defined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dyadicocisnormativity also functions to produce transness, firstly by supposing that individuals whose gender does not match the cisdyadic expectation must instead be attempting its alternative, and secondly by imposing the requirement that if an individual's sex and gender <em>don't</em> match in the dyadicocisnormatively prescribed way, one or the other must be brought into line.
                    Transnormative expectations that non&ndash;gender-conforming individuals must desire surgury or at least hormones perform a re-situating of queer bodies into dyadicocisnormative prescibed lines by allowing the mutability of sex insofar as such changes contribute to the normative cohesion of the whole.

                    Under the Millennial fantasy, the patriarchy is considered extinct, and dyadicocisnormativity is often illegible.
                    As such, it is easy to view gender as a vestige of the past&mdash;more often than not, this ends up naturalizing masculinity while targeting femininity as excessive, irrational, or unneccessary.
                    As Millennials come to recognize the extent to which gender still operates in modern society, however&mdash;getting woke, either through deep conversations, sustained microaggressions, or traumatic events like #GamerGate&mdash;they become more and more aware of the extent to which their bodies are interpellated as gendered subjects.
                    This contrast&mdash;between thinking of oneself as a nongendered subject in a nongendered world and realising the profound extent to which gender shapes our daily lives&mdash;can be traumatic for individuals whose interpellated form differs significantly from their initial viewing of themselves.

                    However, Millenials are provided with a surprising amount of agency in shaping the way in which their bodies are perceived and interpellated&mdash;and they're damn good at it, too.
                    As the musical artist Halsey <a href="http://www.popjustice.com/articles/halsey-interview-i-dont-believe-people-who-say-theyre-themselves-all-the-time/139218/" target="_blank">recently commented in an interview</a>, <q>We've created a generation that knows how to brand itself. Think about social media, usernames, profile pictures, the tweets you're putting out&mdash;you are branding yourself‚Ä¶ The same website where a mom is posting a picture of her children at the beach because she wants to share it with her family&mdash;on that same website someone else is making $100,000 off of a sponsored post because they've garnered so much attention.</q>
                    Especially in online spaces, where the visibility of dyadic sex is often optional, Millenials who have identified the mechanisms of interpellation are often able to twist them to their advantage, challenging cisdyadic and patriarchical norms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are the politics of representation, where identity becomes a statement, and perception is everything.
                    <q>I want to be a visible agender person of color, and I want other young trans people to have someone to look at and see themselves reflected. I never had that growing up, and that is super important to me. I feel like my life would be very different if I had known anyone who was non-binary, or if I had known there were other genders than male and female,</q> Tyler recounts in a statement published in Rachel Syme's article, <a href="https://medium.com/matter/selfie-fe945dcba6b0" target="_blank"><i>SELFIE</i></a>.
                    <q>Selfie politics are attention politics: it is all about who gets to be seen, who gets to occupy the visual field,</q> Syme remarks.
                    <q>Nothing destabilizes power more than an individual that knows his or her own worth.</q>

                <p>
                    But identity is also a burden.
                    Two months before the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, Cord Jefferson published a piece in <i>Matter</i> titled <a href="https://medium.com/matter/the-racism-beat-6ff47f76cbb6#.8sn262cvs" target="_blank"><i>The Racism Beat: What it‚Äôs like to write about hate over and over and over</i></a>.
                    <q>The hostility directed at writers who cover minority beats in America is solid proof that those people are doing important work,</q> he remarked.
                    <q>But that work can be exhausting. It‚Äôs exhausting to always be writing and thinking about a new person being racist or sexist or otherwise awful. It‚Äôs exhausting to feel compelled on a consistent basis to defend your claim to dignity. It‚Äôs exhausting to then watch those defenses drift beyond the reaches of the internet‚Äôs short memory, or to coffee tables in dentists‚Äô offices, to be forgotten about until you link to them the next time you need to say essentially the same thing.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When identity is a statement, every action becomes political.
                    The important work that you do, whatever it may be, will always be overshadowed by the fact that, for example, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/05/29/all-the-women-i-know-in-video.html" target="_blank">you're a woman writing about video games</a>, or, idk, a genderqueer person <em>existing</em>.
                    Representation is important, but the burden of representing is bullshit as fuck.

                <aside>these are mostly just notes and need to be filled out</aside>
                <p>
                    Question: what does the world look like without gender?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Post-Millennials: still shitty tbh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> obviously situates itself firmly within a dyadicocispatriarchical structure.
                    But let's look at gender, and presentation, and what people are actually doing.
                    Outside of the dyadicocisnormative assumption that people with boobs are feminine and people without are masculine (more or less), does the film depict <i>femininity</i> and <i>masculinity</i> in distinct ways?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or hey let's look at <i>Korra</i>. As already stated, when viewed with dyadicocisnormative assumptions, <i>Korra</i> depicts diversity in femininity and troubles the idea of gender as monolithic.
                    But when viewed <em>outside</em> of those assumptions, can you even assign <em>femininity</em> and <em>masculinity</em> to its subjects?
                </p>
                <aside>
                    steven universe again here once i have a better idea of what i'm going to say
                </aside>
                <p>
                    This is the post-millenial mindset: simultaneously functioning within and outside of dyadicocispatriarchial roles and perceptions.
                    Post-Millenials <small>((can))</small> recognize and understand dyadicocispatriarchy and actively work to subvert it through identity; representation; politics.
                    But they were also raised to view the world outside of it, to view these structures as antiquated and unneccessary, blah blah.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But hey not everything is happy!
                    I know I'm getting romantic here but let's be real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, a summary of things: how dyadicocispatriarchial things are framed, how post-millennial conceive and challenge, operating simultaneously within and without; post-gender but not without gender.
                </p>
                <h1>Post-gender but not without gender.</h1>
