            <h2>So here's the deal:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The gender binary is shitty.</li>
                <li>Resisting the gender binary means resisting binary gender categorizations.</li>
                <li>Current english third-person pronouns create binary gender categorizations.</li>
                <li>We need new pronouns which don't do that.</li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>
            <p>Now, <strong>none of this is news.</strong> People have been talking about how the pronoun binary has problems for ages, and proposed various solutions as well. As a linguist, I have a few qualms with the attempts so far and so am putting forth my own solution here for further reference. <small>(Importantly, this gives me something to cite in my college essays so that my pronoun choices sound more official.)</small></p>
            <p>For those wanting to get straight to the point, the proposed pronoun set is as follows: <b><i>ve</i>/<i>vem</i>/<i>vy</i>/<i>vyne</i></b>. What follows is a discussion of why.</p>
            <section id="they">
                <h2>On <i>they</i>:</h2>
                <p>So the well-established pronoun used for nonbinary folx is usually cited as <i>they</i>. <i>They</i> is a plural pronoun, and it's important to clarify what <q>plural</q> means when talking about the english language. In grade-school they teach you <q>plural</q> means <q>more than one,</q> but that's not actually quite right: In English, plural forms are ambiguous.</p>
                <p>One easily identifiable instance of this is when dealing with zero: Note we say <q>zero strawberries are</q> not <q>zero strawberry is,</q> even though zero isn't more than one (the same holds true for fractions). We also see this when the number of something is unknown: <q>How many strawberries are there?</q> Note that in this case the number of strawberries <em>could be one,</em> so we can't even say that plural forms are strictly non-singular.</p>
                <p>The main consequence of this is that using a plural pronoun like <i>they</i> to refer to a single person isn't agrammatical, it just doesn't make sense when a more precise pronoun could be used instead. <i>They</i> has a long history of being used to refer to people of ambiguous number, gender, or definiteness. The problem with using <i>they</i> as our sole nonbinary singular pronoun, however, is that it is also ambiguous when it comes to one other factor: <em>animacy</em>. Maybe it's just me, but using the same pronoun to refer to someone as you use to refer to your underpants seems kinda problematic.</p>
                <aside>
                    <p>This is not to bash anyone who has decided to use <i>they</i> to identify themselves, or anyone for that matter who uses <i>they</i> out of consideration of others' potential nonbinary status. My point is that while <i>they</i> may be the best option in some circumstances, this has less to do with its own excellence than it does to do with the fact that <i>he</i> and <i>she</i> are shitty alternatives.</p>
                </aside>
                <p>Although <i>they</i> works in a lot of cases, people who identify with it have to put up with always being referred to ambiguously‚ÄîAre they a person or a thing? One or several?‚Äîand that's a problem that people who use <i>he</i> or <i>she</i> never have to face. We can do better.</p>

                <h2>Forming a new pronoun set:</h2>
                <p>If we're going to ditch <i>they</i>, though, we need something to replace it. In terms of our root sound, we want something that sounds natural but doesn't conflict with existing words. We can note the following about existing personal pronouns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the consonant-sound of existing pronouns is generally formed in the front of the mouth (<i>m</i>e, <i>th</i>ee, <i>w</i>e)</li>
                    <li>the consonant-sound of existing pronouns is generally fricative (<i>th</i>ee, <i>sh</i>e, <i>h</i>e) or approximant (<i>y</i>ou, <i>w</i>e)</li>
                    <li>the consonant-sound of existing pronouns is generally voiced (<i>m</i>e, <i>th</i>ee, <i>w</i>e, <i>y</i>ou)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Given the trends above, the consonant-sound that makes the most sense for our genderless pronoun is <i>v</i>: It has all of these properties, and isn't used in any current pronouns.</p>
                <p>In terms of declensions, I originally planned to model things after the historical first- and second- person pronouns <i>I</i> and <i>thou</i>. This would provide <i>vey</i>/<i>ve</i>/<i>vy</i>/<i>vyne</i>, but for a current speaker of English, who is used to <i>he</i>/<i>him</i> and <i>she</i>/<i>her</i>, <i>vey</i>/<i>ve</i> sounds backwards. So instead, I propose we let the nominative form be <i>ve</i>, and model the accusative/objective after <i>them</i>: <i>vem</i>. <i>vy</i> and <i>vyne</i> should be familiar possessive forms due to the prevalence of <i>my</i> and <i>mine</i>.</p>
                <p>Here are some sample sentences which demonstrate <i>ve</i>'s versatility and intuitiveness (try reading them out loud!):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ve walked to the park. I saw vem there.</li>
                    <li>When I passed vem, ve was walking vy dog.</li>
                    <li>That book is vyne but I'm borrowing it for the day.</li>
                </ul>
                <aside>
                    <p>You might find yourself pronouncing <i>ve</i> in a manner similar to <i>they</i>. That's okay! <i>ve</i> is flexible and can accommodate a variety of pronunciations.</p>
