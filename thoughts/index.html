                <h2>an imperfect venture</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, when we have a lot of time, or something affects us on a continual basis, for those of us who prefer to communicate through the written word, we sit down and compose a nice, well-formed essay that explains in a nice, accessible way where we're coming from and what we're thinking.</p>
                <p>And sometimes we just need to rant.</p>
                <p>This is the home both of these things, and everything in between (essays are a <span data-colour="red">s</span><span data-colour="yellow">p</span><span data-colour="green">e</span><span data-colour="teal">c</span><span data-colour="cyan">t</span><span data-colour="blue">r</span><span data-colour="purple">u</span><span data-colour="magenta">m</span>). The thoughts and opinions expressed here may be raw and flawed, existing in that temporal flux between first-impression and understanding. In my mind, that makes them more human. These posts are mistakes waiting to happen, the inevitable vulnerability of trying to express oneself without first achieving that impossible state of having "all the facts".</p>
                <p>Because of the temporal nature of their existence and the fragile connection they have with my opinions in the future, these posts are designed to fade. Expect them to unexpectedly disappear after their opinions no longer reflect my own or they cease to be relevant. For those hidden gems you find, a plain-text download link has been provided, and since this entire site is hosted on <u>GitHub Pages</u>, a full revision history will always be available for those willing to do the digging.</p>
                <p>Welcome to my thoughts. Consider this your introduction.</p>
